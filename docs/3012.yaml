- en: When I first started my PhD three years ago, I was very new to the world of
    academia and the process of publishing in journals and conferences. Coming from
    Computer Engineering, my PhD involved design research, and I felt that the publishing
    process for human-computer interaction, design, design engineering, design research,
    and other related spaces was more ambigious than computer science or other purely
    STEM subjects.

    many people associated publishing with success as a researcher. Publishing seemed
    important, even critical, not only for the PhD, but for my career as an academic
    or researcher (even for some places in industry).

- en: I’m referring to publishing as having a paper accepted at a journal or conference.
    This typically involves a **peer-review** process, which means that **two or more
    reviewers** read and approve your paper. These reviewers are usually ‘**experts**’
    on the topic you’ve written the paper on, which could mean they’re academics,
    researchers, industry experts, etc. This process is usually **blind,** meaning
    that your name and institution are hidden from reviewers to avoid any biases.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A paper can only be submitted to **one venue at a time** and can only be resubmitted
    to a second place if rejected or withdrawn from the first place. Sometimes a journal
    paper describing a study can be repurposed as a conference paper, and vice versa.
    That’s only if there’s a significantly different angle or extension presented
    for the same study/data, but otherwise it’s usually one study = one paper.

    to make sure you’ve collected all the papers that exist on a topic) and doing
    some **analysis** (i.e., not just saying ‘these are the papers that exist’, but
    also looking for trends or patterns that can be learned from looking at the combination
    of these papers as a whole).'

    participants and include methods like surveys, interviews, workshops, ethnography,

    background and context to your study, then you’ll summarise the methods you used

- en: Remember that you’re not doing a PhD or doing research just to publish. **Your
    goal is to do good quality research that is impactful, and then publishing is
    just a consequence of that and a way of sharing your work with the wider community.**
    Take the time to identify what you want to research and develop an air-tight methodology.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In terms of a PhD, I recommend breaking it up into a series of studies that
    answer mini-questions, which then work towards your main research question. In
    that sense, every study is publish-able as its own paper (which is what I did).
    It is also incredibly helpful to write up the paper for each study as you do it
    or as soon as you finish it, because then everything is written up and clear,
    and this will save you massive time when you write your thesis at the end.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another way of getting publications is collaborating with other researchers
    on their projects and studies. This might not get you a **first author** publication,
    where the first author is usually the person who did the majority of the work,
    but it can contribute towards your overall publication count and show that you
    collaborate well with others. In my experience, your first author publications
    are the most impactful ones, where other authors are usually ordered by the size
    of their contributions and then the last author(s) are the supervisors of the
    work or the most senior people.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The next step is to pick out the place you want to publish your work in. I’m
    going to list some impactful design journals and conferences below, but a good
    rule of thumb is to check where the papers you have cited in your paper come from.
    If you find you’ve referenced a specific journal or conference many times, that’s
    a good indicator that your research might fit in well there. Otherwise, it’s important
    to check the **impact factor** of different venues. This number indicates how
    impactful the papers published at this venue have been (this is a mix of number
    of times they’re cited and other metrics). Generally, design and human-computer
    interaction will have lower impact scores than a field like medicine, where papers
    will be much more impactful overall. 3 is quite a good impact factor for design
    research in my experience.

    Remember that writing a paper and submitting it is in itself a milestone that
    you should celebrate! The review process is long and can take several months.
    It’s important to keep that in mind when you’re planning publications, especially
    if you want them published before finishing your PhD. The different decisions
    that reviewers could make on your paper will vary from venue to venue, but they
    generally will be:'

- en: ⏳ **Accept with Minor Revisions** — Conditional acceptance if you implement
    some feedback reviewers have left you. Usually this is minor stuff around the

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ⚠️ **Accept with Major Revisions / Revise and Resubmit** — This means the reviewers
    think there is promise and value in your paper, but there are major changes that
    need to be made. This might mean having to redo a part of the study or collect
    more data, or it might mean a major re-write of the paper itself. On average you’ll
    get around 3 months to do these. In my experience, this decision is a good thing.
    It means there’s no fatal flaw where the paper must be rejected. With some hard
    work and a good **response letter** where you explain how you’ve addressed reviewers’
    feedback, you’ll be bumped up to accept or accept with minor revisions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 🛑 **Reject** — That means there’s either a fatal flaw in the paper or it is
    completely irrelevant to the venue you’ve selected. I’ve had outright rejections
    before and they can be discouraging. A good place to start is the reviewers’ detailed
    feedback to understand how you can improve the study or the paper. I’ve had rejections
    that ended up being accepted in the end, so don’t throw work out just because
    of a rejection!

    The majority of my papers came at the end of my second year and during my third
    year of the PhD. If you’re just starting out, simply put publishing as a long
    term goal and focus first on structuring the degree in terms of studies and carrying
    those out well. Submitting papers on different studies is also a great way to
    get feedback and catch any issues early on, instead of getting a nasty surprise
    later on in your defense/viva, or when it’s too late to repeat a study. **By taking
    it as a chance to learn and get feedback, you’ll realise that you always benefit
    from submitting a paper, even if the outcome is a rejection for now.**
