Do you know what this position is about? No? That’s right, I didn’t either. All I saw in the job description was that it required 3–5 years of experience in Data Science. So I thought, this has something to do with data, so why not. I got the job and started working there. Turns out that “Commercial Intelligence” was a job description that was basically business intelligence for the commercial department. Lucky me, it was spot on. It gave me the opportunity to start experimenting with business intelligence.</p><figure class="nm nn no np nq nr nj nk paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="ns nt ed nu bh nv"><div class="nj nk qf"><img src="../Images/27a9d1a312da9ad766909bfcc947dbaa.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*OT_eh5X1vj-X_vXrU9fMaQ.jpeg"/></div></div><figcaption class="nx ny nz nj nk oa ob bf b bg z dx">Business Intelligence (BI) is defined as “<strong class="bf oe">The technical infrastructure that collects, stores and analyzes company data</strong>”.

And so I did.</p><p id="8ccb" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn fq mp b go mq mr ms gr mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni fj bk">Before I knew it, my engineering skills were back. All the problem solving skills that I got throughout the years, the bug for solving challenges and the exposure to different programming languages started connecting with each other. I started building automations in Power BI, then extended this to writing SQL to automate more things and then building data pipelines using Python. In 1 year’s time, I had all my processes pretty much automated and I knew that I had the technical capability to take on more challenging and technically intensive problems. I built incredible dashboards that brought useful insights to the business owners and that felt incredible.</p><p id="66c2" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn fq mp b go mq mr ms gr mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni fj bk"><strong class="mp fr">This was the lightbulb moment</strong>.

I expanded my knowledge to more things such as AI, real-time streaming data pipelines, APIs, automations and so much more. Job opportunities are coming up all the time and I feel fortunate that I have made this switch, and I couldn’t recommend it enough. Was it challenging? I’ll say that the only challenging part in both BI and data engineering positions was the first 3 months until I got to know the tools we use and the environments. My engineering expertise equipped me well to deal with different problems with excitement and do amazing things. I wouldn’t change my degree for anything else. Not even for a Computer Science degree. How did my engineering degree help throughout this transition? This is discussed in the next section.</p><h2 id="8b18" class="pm od fq bf oe pn po pp oh pq pr ps ok mw pt pu pv na pw px py ne pz qa qb qc bk">How Engineering equips you with skills that help in a data career</h2><p id="d73c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn fq mp b go oy mr ms gr oz mu mv mw pa my mz na pb nc nd ne pc ng nh ni fj bk">So if you’ve read this far, you must be wondering: <em class="mo">How is my engineering degree preparing me for a career in data? This guy has told me nothing about this</em>. You are right, let’s get into it.</p><p id="3f96" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn fq mp b go mq mr ms gr mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni fj bk">Engineering degrees are important, not because of the discipline but the way that they structure the brains of those they study it. This is my personal opinion, but going through my engineering degrees they have exposed me to so many things and have prepared me to solve problems in every single bit that I feel much more confident now. But let’s get to the specifics. These are some key engineering skills that I see similarities and I get to use at my data role every single day:</p><ol class=""><li id="3758" class="mm mn fq mp b go mq mr ms gr mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni pe pf pg bk"><strong class="mp fr">Programming:</strong> As an electrical and electronics engineer, I got exposure to multiple programming languages throughout my degrees. I used assembly language, Java, VHDL, C and Matlab. Likewise, I think other engineering disciplines do the same thing since programming is a way to perform simulations in engineering. Even though I haven’t used Python or SQL during my degrees, it was a seamless transition to these two, after getting exposed to so many things. I would even say enjoyable, since I used to hate coding during my bachelor degree, but now I love it. It probably was a matter of tight deadlines and stress from so many things at the same time.</li><li id="52d2" class="mm mn fq mp b go ph mr ms gr pi mu mv mw pj my mz na pk nc nd ne pl ng nh ni pe pf pg bk"><strong class="mp fr">Problem Solving:</strong> I get to solve problems every day but as my first university lecturer said to us at the very first day at the university, “Google is your friend”. If you have a knack for solving problems, and you have been exposed to the way engineering projects are handed out at universities (where they basically give you a one paragraph description for the project and expect a product by the end of the week), believe me you can solve data problems. You have been through enough preparation.</li><li id="32d5" class="mm mn fq mp b go ph mr ms gr pi mu mv mw pj my mz na pk nc nd ne pl ng nh ni pe pf pg bk"><strong class="mp fr">Math and Statistics:</strong> Engineering students get through intense mathematics such as linear algebra, calculus, statistics and others that can make you understand machine learning in a smooth transition. It’s a bit difficult to grasp at first because it’s a new territory but you’ll get the hang of it.</li><li id="1345" class="mm mn fq mp b go ph mr ms gr pi mu mv mw pj my mz na pk nc nd ne pl ng nh ni pe pf pg bk"><strong class="mp fr">Black Box Problems:</strong> I don’t even know if this is a formal definition but I consider “Black Box” problems to be the ones that are extremely difficult to solve, we’ve been using them, they work, but not a lot of people actually know what’s happening in the background. In data, the “Black Box Problem” is AI. It’s hot, it works and it’s amazing but no one really knows what’s happening in the background. Similarly, engineering disciplines have their own “Black Box” problems. Sure, AI is difficult but have you tried understanding the power network problem? That’s no walk in the park.</li><li id="9a2a" class="mm mn fq mp b go ph mr ms gr pi mu mv mw pj my mz na pk nc nd ne pl ng nh ni pe pf pg bk"><strong class="mp fr">Modelling and Simulations:</strong> Every engineer student has been doing modelling and simulations and that’s nothing different from ML models and data models.</li><li id="1991" class="mm mn fq mp b go ph mr ms gr pi mu mv mw pj my mz na pk nc nd ne pl ng nh ni pe pf pg bk"><strong class="mp fr">Data Processing and Analytics:</strong> As an engineer student in my bachelor and PhD degrees I did a lot of data processing, transformation and analytics from oscilloscope files, sensor files and smart devices that had millions of rows of data. These are examples of data pipelines as we call them in the data industry. I didn’t really know at the time though that this was the name for it. When I got to do it in a corporate environment, these skills were transferrable and helped so much.</li><li id="e74f" class="mm mn fq mp b go ph mr ms gr pi mu mv mw pj my mz na pk nc nd ne pl ng nh ni pe pf pg bk"><strong class="mp fr">Automations:</strong> Engineers hate repeated procedures. If there’s a way to automate something, they will do it. This is the mindset that a data engineer needs. I carried this mindset to my data engineer position and it helps a lot since I spend a lot of time automating stuff in my day to day.</li><li id="6215" class="mm mn fq mp b go ph mr ms gr pi mu mv mw pj my mz na pk nc nd ne pl ng nh ni pe pf pg bk"><strong class="mp fr">Presenting and explaining to non-technical people:</strong> One very common thing I was doing in my PhD was explaining my project to non-technical people so that they can understand what I’m doing. This happens a lot in data. You prepare a lot of analysis for business people so you have to be able to explain it too.</li></ol><p id="5ecb" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn fq mp b go mq mr ms gr mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni fj bk">All the above help me every single day in my data engineer position. Can you see the transferrable skills now?</p><h1 id="0c1a" class="oc od fq bf oe of og gq oh oi oj gt ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou ov ow ox bk">So, is it a happy ending?</h1><p id="3f4b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn fq mp b go oy mr ms gr oz mu mv mw pa my mz na pb nc nd ne pc ng nh ni fj bk">Whilst I don’t want to encourage all the engineering disciplines to jump into a data position, I still think that all engineers are useful, I wanted to write this article to encourage the people that want to do the switch. There’s so much rejection nowadays but at the same time opportunities. All you need is the right opportunity and then magic will follow since you will be able to exploit your skills. <strong class="mp fr">The important thing is to keep trying.</strong></p><blockquote class="mj mk ml"><p id="7a4a" class="mm mn mo mp b go mq mr ms gr mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni fj bk">If you liked this article, please give me a few claps and follow me on <a class="af pd" href="https://medium.com/@loizosloizou08" rel="noopener">https://medium.com/@loizosloizou08</a></p><p id="a073" class="mm mn mo mp b go mq mr ms gr mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni fj bk">There’s more content to follow :)</p></blockquote></div></div></div></div>
