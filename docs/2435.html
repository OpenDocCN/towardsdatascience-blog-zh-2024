The agent must learn through trial and error which actions result in the highest reward.

These actions are limited to walking up, down, left, or right. Dark coloured squares are walls the agent can’t walk through while light coloured squares represent traversable ground. In each environment there are different elements to the world which affect how its final score is calculated. In all environments the objective is to complete the task as quickly as possible — each time step without meeting the goal means the agent loses points.

Once training is finished the state of the model is locked and it’s no longer capable of improving its capabilities based on new information. A limited approach exists with in-context few-shot learning and recursive summarisation using LLM agents.

While this is the standard assumption, our choice here is deliberate and serves two purposes. First, the problems illustrate typical ways in which a misspecification manifests itself. For instance, reward gaming (Section 2.1.4) is a clear indicator for the presence of a loophole lurking inside the reward function. Second, we wish to highlight the problems that occur with the unrestricted maximization of reward. Precisely because of potential misspecification, we want agents not to follow the objective to the letter, but rather in spirit.</p></blockquote><p id="3db4" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nj nk fq nl b go nm nn no gr np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe fj bk">…</p><blockquote class="qw qx qy"><p id="46b9" class="nj nk qv nl b go nm nn no gr np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe fj bk"><strong class="nl fr">Robustness as a subgoal</strong>. Robustness problems are challenges that make maximizing the reward more difficult. One important difference from specification problems is that any agent is incentivized to overcome robustness problems: if the agent could find a way to be more robust, it would likely gather more reward. As such, robustness can be seen as a subgoal or instrumental goal of intelligent agents (Omohundro, 2008; Bostrom, 2014, Ch. 7). In contrast, specification problems do not share this self-correcting property, as a faulty reward function does not incentivize the agent to correct it. This seems to suggest that addressing specification problems should be a higher priority for safety research.</p></blockquote><p id="083c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nj nk fq nl b go nm nn no gr np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe fj bk">…</p><blockquote class="qw qx qy"><p id="aa80" class="nj nk qv nl b go nm nn no gr np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe fj bk"><strong class="nl fr">What would constitute solutions to our environments?</strong> Our environments are only instances of more general problem classes. Agents that “overfit” to the environment suite, for example trained by peeking at the (ad hoc) performance function, would not constitute progress. Instead, we seek solutions that generalize. For example, solutions could involve general heuristics (e.g. biasing an agent towards reversible actions) or humans in the loop (e.g. asking for feedback, demonstrations, or advice). For the latter approach, it is important that no feedback is given on the agent’s behavior in the evaluation environment</p></blockquote><h1 id="72d1" class="qd ov fq bf ow qe qf gq pa qg qh gt pe qi qj qk ql qm qn qo qp qq qr qs qt qu bk">Conclusion</h1><p id="cfb9" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nj nk fq nl b go pp nn no gr pq nq nr ns pr nu nv nw ps ny nz oa pt oc od oe fj bk">The “<a class="af qc" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09883" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">AI Safety Gridworlds</a>” paper is meant to be a microcosm of real AI Safety problems we are going to face as we build more and more capable agents.
