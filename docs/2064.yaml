    (weird reason to start Machine Learning) and from Physics I understood that I
    also loved coding and data science a lot. I didn’t really care about the **type**
    of data. All I wanted was to be in front of a computer writing 10k lines of code
    per day.

    will drift you to some kinds of data rather than others.

    a lot of **signal** processing. If you work at **Netflix**, you might end up working
    with a lot of **NLP** and **recommendation** **systems**. If you work at **Tesla**
    you will most definitely be a **Computer Vision** expert and work with images.
