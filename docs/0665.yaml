    I started like everybody else in a Jupyter Notebook, processing the data and training
    models cell by cell.

    with markdowns, the code began to get messy.

    it was almost easier to create a new notebook. Requirements had changed. The code
    was too messy to attempt any modifications.

    Data had to be processed identically across the notebook, in the training pipeline,
    and in the inference pipeline.
