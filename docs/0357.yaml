- en: Super Bowl Sunday has historically captivated the American audience by catering
    to diverse interests. Football fanatics are enthralled by the on-field action,
    while casual viewers are entertained by the spectacle — from captivating commercials
    to dazzling halftime shows. However, today’s Super Bowl transcends the traditional
    two-audience dynamic. This year, for example, Taylor Swift’s dedicated fanbase
    (“Swifties”) might tune in to witness her potential interactions with Travis Kelce
    as the Kansas City Chiefs seek to defend their championship title. Moreover, the
    burgeoning legal sports betting landscape, coupled with the Las Vegas location
    of the game, adds an extra element of adrenaline for both seasoned and recreational
    bettors.

- en: This article goes out to those who know the general rules of football but are
    more of a “good hang” than a diehard fan. If you like to enjoy the various chips
    & dips at your gathering with family and/or friends and wouldn’t mind adding some
    excitement to the biggest football game of the year in a “bingo”-esque fashion,
    then allow me to introduce you to Super Bowl squares.
