    that “*communicating our work is as important as writing code and building the
    models and products to get the job done.”*

    junior ones) struggling with the story-telling part of the job. They have all
    the data in hand, but for some reason the message just doesn’t seem to get through
    to the audience and the analysis ends up being another pretty report on the bookshelf
    collecting dust with no impact. So what exactly went wrong?

- en: A lot of data scientists communicate in a linear manner (what is demonstrated
    on the left in the graph below). This is understandable because that’s how we
    experience things, and also how we tell stories in our everyday lives. But it’s
    not the most effective way to get important information across because audience
    can easily get lost or bored in this type of communication.
