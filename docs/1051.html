I learned that I love collaborating with different roles across the organization, that I am really good at bringing structure to chaos, aligning cross-functional stakeholders, building long-term product visions, strategy, and roadmaps, and most interestingly, picking up things/projects no one else is picking! 🤷‍♀</p><figure class="or os ot ou ov ow oo op paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="ox oy ed oz bh pa"><div class="oo op ph"><img src="../Images/20e1342cd08c5be5f02e21631accb2c0.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/0*2hbNoLqFqUl7jWh5"/></div></div><figcaption class="pc pd pe oo op pf pg bf b bg z dx">Photo by <a class="af nf" href="https://unsplash.com/@joszczepanska?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Jo Szczepanska</a> on <a class="af nf" href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p id="0b2a" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">I also learned that coming from a data background, I enjoy data and ML optimization problems A LOT MORE than the frontend/UX side of product management, that software engineering development is SO different from data science/ML development, that DATA WINS over politics, that I love working in collaborative environments more than competitive environments, and that we are STILL just getting started in the Data Product era.</p><p id="3d17" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">I have tapped into different communities and built a stronger network among people in Data/ML/AI, Product and a combination of both — some of which I keep crossing paths once in a while over time!

Most importantly, I cherrypicked their best skills for me to replicate — communication, strategic thinking, handling conflicts, change management, dealing with black swan events(aka Covid pandemic), process efficiency, stakeholder management, developing people, managing upwards, fostering collaboration, approaching problems with a beginner’s mindset, decision-making frameworks, owning responsibilities, drawing boundaries and so on.</p><p id="6237" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">I also learned how NOT to lead in some situations, either through observations or through people’s feedback on my working style.

I knew then that whatever I do in my work has to be centered around people — not the business, not the product, but those who make it real, daily. Sure, the product and business would be there to bring problem statements to collaborate on, but as long as there’s collaboration with amazing people — I found myself happy and having fun at work!</p></div></div></div><div class="ab cb ng nh ni nj" role="separator"><span class="nk by bm nl nm nn"/><span class="nk by bm nl nm nn"/><span class="nk by bm nl nm"/></div><div class="fj fk fl fm fn"><div class="ab cb"><div class="ci bh ev ew ex ey"><h2 id="0f87" class="no np fq bf nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny ms nz oa ob mw oc od oe na of og oh oi bk">What made me take a break from my PM career when AI Product Managers were all the hype?</h2><p id="aeac" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go oj mn mo gr ok mq mr ms ol mu mv mw om my mz na on nc nd ne fj bk">Quite honestly, <strong class="ml fr">I was pretty burnt out.</strong> I have been studying and working nonstop without a break for 15 years since 2009. All the while, I moved countries, transitioned my career twice, worked in 5 companies, and tried starting up and shutting it down—it was time for me to take a break from the corporate job, have some more flexibility in my schedule, and have some space to re-invest in myself in both personal and professional directions.</p><p id="6932" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">Having worked in the Data/ML/AI space for almost a decade, <strong class="ml fr">I know it’s not going anywhere</strong> — that if I were to come back in a year, it wouldn’t be so hard to catch up — it might actually be better for me to be away in this time where things haven’t settled down in this space, given that I don’t particularly enjoy 0-to-1 projects that much. This chain of thought gave me a lot more comfort than the FOMO of not being involved so actively in building the next genAI products for the market.</p><p id="ec67" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">In the meantime, I decided to pick up <strong class="ml fr">a new skill that has more to do with people than technology</strong>.

It’s bringing me a lot of joy and fulfillment, the excitement to be new and raw at something again, and the challenge of bringing it to a substantial level.</p><figure class="or os ot ou ov ow oo op paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="ox oy ed oz bh pa"><div class="oo op pi"><img src="../Images/5d85704889fea30754e4b8b2fcff125d.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/0*YUvILOcHIEv_yu5I"/></div></div><figcaption class="pc pd pe oo op pf pg bf b bg z dx">Photo by <a class="af nf" href="https://unsplash.com/@desalaberry?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Julien de Salaberry</a> on <a class="af nf" href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p id="66b1" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">I decided to expand on one of the leadership and people skills I enjoyed a lot in all these years: <strong class="ml fr">Coaching</strong>! It has opened a whole new world for me, introduced me to an amazing community of like-minded people, all in service of growing others, and has given me the opportunity to impact individuals directly and deeply.

I have also chosen <strong class="ml fr">to support big career transitioners</strong> like me because I recognize that it’s not easy and it takes courage to leap — I don’t like watching people hold themselves back from something amazing they are capable of because of their fears and limiting beliefs — be it switching industries or moving to entrepreneurship.</p><p id="832b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">P.S.: If any of these resonates with you, and you would like to explore working with a coach, you know where to <a class="af nf" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/varsha-lalwani/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">find</a> me. 😉</p></div></div></div><div class="ab cb ng nh ni nj" role="separator"><span class="nk by bm nl nm nn"/><span class="nk by bm nl nm nn"/><span class="nk by bm nl nm"/></div><div class="fj fk fl fm fn"><div class="ab cb"><div class="ci bh ev ew ex ey"><h2 id="4cb1" class="no np fq bf nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny ms nz oa ob mw oc od oe na of og oh oi bk">What does the professional identity(s) mean to me?</h2><p id="978e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go oj mn mo gr ok mq mr ms ol mu mv mw om my mz na on nc nd ne fj bk">That brings me to this million-dollar question of identity and self-worth and how <strong class="ml fr">people these days attach so much of it to their job role or employer brand.</strong> I did, too.

It was only when I stepped into a new possibility of multiple identities coexisting that I could allow myself to choose among them intentionally — like pillars of a greek temple — all supporting me in different ways.
