- en: 'Last week while we were at an AI & Physics conference ([EuCAIFCon](https://indico.nikhef.nl/event/4875/)),
    a lot of the discussions were on Foundational models and whether it is possible
    to discover potentially new laws in Physics using AI, and lo and behold: recently
    the KAN paper¹ came out in arXiv discussing possibilities of discovering/rediscovering
    physics and mathematical models using neural net.'

    and here we will take a deep dive into the math, formulations, and ideas behind
    constructing KANs. We will also install KAN to check one of the many amazing results
    presented in the paper by the MIT researchers.

    concepts to appreciate why this network is causing such a big fuss!

    & Arnold’s representation theorem. So first let’s take a few steps back to understand
    this theorem.
