    insights using Python, this would have secured you a great job as a **data scientist
    10 years ago**. Nowadays, you may still have a shot in a traditional organization
    like a large insurance company. However, if you are trying to **join a unicorn
    tech startup** as a data scientist, you better know how to train ML models, deploy
    them to the cloud, and set up monitoring and retraining mechanisms with data,
    model, and code versioning. If you have 10+ years of experience using ChatGPT,
    that’s another plus.

    example** with a clear and believable roadmap to tangible business outcomes. However,
    this is **not always possible**. In these cases, my tip is to make the ambassador
    argument (point 3). Most companies are hesitant to invest substantial resources
    into a rising technology. A much cheaper solution is to invest in the education
    of individuals who **act as ambassadors and drive experimentation with the technology**
    in the organization, potentially leading to strong use cases at minimal resource
    investment.
