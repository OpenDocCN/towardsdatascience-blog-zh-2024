    as a summer intern. Their task was to develop a machine learning model to predict
    air quality in our city, using Jupyter notebooks, basic Python and scikit-learn.

    asked them to change a graph: instead of plotting the predicted versus true values,
    I asked them to show the *difference* between the predicted and true values.'

    the difference between two arrays y1 and y2”* and continued to copy and paste
    the answer *“y1 — y2”* into the notebook.

    that is so simple, and certainly faster to write yourself than to prompt, wait,
    and copy and paste. But then I started thinking about the implications of AI assistants
    for the way we teach software development and the learning outcomes for students.
