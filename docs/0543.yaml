- en: I remember the first time I used [SHAP](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/introduction-to-shap-with-python-d27edc23c454).
    Well, tried to use it. I wanted to understand an XGBoost model trained with over
    40 features and many of those were highly correlated. The plots looked cool! But,
    that was pretty much it.

    the [XAI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuDijSIR9iM) method’s fault… the underlying
    data was a mess. This was my first realisation that:'

    their inner workings. Yet, if used correctly, they can provide incredible insight.

    I’ve narrowed the lessons down to 10 tips. Seen below, they are roughly divided
    into 3 groups. The first four tips focus on the underlying data used to train
    models. The next four focus on *you* as a user of XAI methods. The last two delve
    into more technical considerations.
