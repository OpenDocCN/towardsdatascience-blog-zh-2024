    something about itself,’ as [this article reported](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/08/robot-wrote-this-article-gpt-3).
    However, this was only accessible and ‘usable’ by those with a relatively strong

    a negative connotation in education. [This is the same for art, which deserves
    another article.] As educators, we do not wish/want our students to generate answers
    for the tasks we give them and hand them in for grading. That is why there is
    usually an adverse first reaction to AI in the learning process.

    a probabilistic approach. This means that every output differs from the one before,
    even if the same prompt is used to create it. If I copy someone else’s work and
    submit it as my own, what I copy is comparable and detected as plagiarism. Using
    Generative AI to create your work is a different form of misconduct. Because it
    is probabilistic, it follows detecting it is also probabilistic.

    content in an educational setting. While it can indicate whether someone used
    AI to generate work, the lack of certainty makes me uncomfortable taking action
    on a student, which might impact their career, when I know the possibility of
    the detection being a false positive.

    Guess what happened? They shut it down by July 2023 because it was “[impossible
