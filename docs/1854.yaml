- en: Have you ever thought about how your GPS always seems to find the fastest route
    to your destination? No matter how many ways there are to get from Point-A to
    Point-B, your GPS sorts through them all and gives you just one route — how does
    it know which route is the best one? In the background, tons of calculations are
    being made using algorithms like Dijkstra’s to find the shortest path between
    where you are and where you’re trying to go. There are many different algorithms
    that can achieve this though, and I’d like to introduce you to a couple of them!
    In this article, I’ll take a look at a popular shortest path algorithm along with
    a more advanced one and show how you can use them for your data projects or just
    for fun!

    watching this [YouTube video by Spanning Tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFg3u_E6eHU&ab_channel=SpanningTree)
    first.

    any two of them. For example if you want to go from Point S to Point P the shortest
    and only path is 2 minutes. However if…
