late January, I’ve gotten tangled up in a couple of its provisions. Some of them regulating emotion recognition technologies, which got me admittedly more tangled up than I originally anticipated. Maybe I was just looking for an excuse for getting back into researching some of my personally favourite topics: human psyche, motivation and manipulation. In any event, I discovered many new and interesting technologies, but was disappointed to find much less exciting legal analyses of the questions they raise. As the hamster wheel in my head continued spinning, I couldn’t help myself but writing some of the things down.</p><p id="7e8b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">The series Emotions-in-the-loop is planned in the following way: I will first set up the scene imagining a hypothetical (although to a greater degree already possible) scenario of a morning in the life of (scanned) Jane. Then, I will describe the technologies that could be used to make this hypothetical scenario a reality, together with referencing patents and papers justifying my claim that we are already at the point where Scanned Jane could exist somewhere out there. The point of this first part will be to demonstrate just how far the technologies can go and to hopefully make the readers wonder at which point the scenario goes from a utopia to a dystopia. At least for them personally.</p><p id="ade9" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">In the following sequels, I will then analyze the legal situation of the fictitious scenario. Hopefully helping demonstrate where some of the gaps in protecting individuals persist in our legal frameworks. I will do that by focusing on the protection provided (or lack thereof) by the GDPR, the recently adopted Data Act, and the upcoming AI Act. The point being: these regulations fail miserably at protecting individuals from some of the (potentially) most useful and at the same time most easily misused technologies available nowadays. Especially when these are combined as in the imagined (admittedly slightly Black-Mirror-like) scenario.</p><p id="967e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">As I’m developing the idea of the series on the go, I have no clue where exactly it might take me. Still, if you are also up for some dangerous speculations paired with far-fetched claims and some legal analysis sprinkled on top, hop on and enjoy the ride!</p></div></div></div><div class="ab cb nz oa ob oc" role="separator"><span class="od by bm oe of og"/><span class="od by bm oe of og"/><span class="od by bm oe of"/></div><div class="fj fk fl fm fn"><div class="ab cb"><div class="ci bh ev ew ex ey"><h1 id="1713" class="oh oi fq bf oj ok ol gq om on oo gt op oq or os ot ou ov ow ox oy oz pa pb pc bk">Painting the Picture: A Morning in the Life of (Scanned) Jane</h1><p id="3331" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go pd nh ni gr pe nk nl nm pf no np nq pg ns nt nu ph nw nx ny fj bk">Jane opens her eyes.

The science behind “high-quality sleep” is also getting increasingly more predictable and therefore also adjustable.

(As well as in terms of the depicted scenario, the lack of self-control to actually go through with our decisions ourselves.) I for one, am sure I’m not going to resolve to these technologies any time soon, but I’m certain some people will. And it is also my opinion that there should be something resembling a line of human dignity and freedom of choice we can never (even willfully) give away. Or should never be able to give away. This does not appear to be the dominating mindset at the moment.</p></div></div></div><div class="ab cb nz oa ob oc" role="separator"><span class="od by bm oe of og"/><span class="od by bm oe of og"/><span class="od by bm oe of"/></div><div class="fj fk fl fm fn"><div class="ab cb"><div class="ci bh ev ew ex ey"><h1 id="8729" class="oh oi fq bf oj ok ol gq om on oo gt op oq or os ot ou ov ow ox oy oz pa pb pc bk">So what’s the big deal?</h1><p id="f012" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go pd nh ni gr pe nk nl nm pf no np nq pg ns nt nu ph nw nx ny fj bk">Now, for the million-dollar question: what’s the big deal? Jane is happy with the technology and not having to worry about what day it is, what she is going to get her mother for her birthday, or how she is going to lose weight, as long as she loses it. Everyone is free to make their own choices, the technology is here to serve us, so why can’t I just let it be?</p><p id="edc0" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">I’ve battled with similar questions a fair bit myself and the only answer I can offer rests on a couple of points, features, characteristics, facts, or whatever you want to call them.</p><ol class=""><li id="d9c4" class="nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny pj pk pl bk">Our environment undeniably has a great influence on us as individuals. However, in comparison to other people expressing their opinions, these technologies work invisibly. We are oftentimes not aware they are doing anything let alone that this affects us. They lock us in filter bubbles. They shape or reaffirm our beliefs. And there isn’t anything we can do about it. How do you fight something that is basically a voice in your own head?</li><li id="7e7f" class="nd ne fq nf b go pm nh ni gr pn nk nl nm po no np nq pp ns nt nu pq nw nx ny pj pk pl bk">Although some people don’t have a problem with technologies subconsciously altering their behaviour (as long as it’s changing them for the better), this is not a universal phenomenon. We should all have <a class="af nc" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.10525.pdf" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">the right to decide how we want to shape our opinions</a>, beliefs, and decisions, as well as be able to change our decisions later on.</li><li id="ed55" class="nd ne fq nf b go pm nh ni gr pn nk nl nm po no np nq pp ns nt nu pq nw nx ny pj pk pl bk">These technologies raise multiple ethical questions on the side of the data processing necessary to train the algorithms, as well as the data processing necessary for them to generate their assumptions and predictions, and finally, as to the effects they may cause. These questions already justify giving the super smart watches, fridges, phones, cars, and glasses (especially when they all work together) a bit more attention. Is there a line to what people can agree to? To be more precise can I agree to an algorithm subconsciously manipulating me to eat healthier? Many would sign that pact with the devil in a heartbeat to have their smartwatch and fridge collaborate and not let them open the fridge after they “spent” all their calories for the day or the clock has ticked 8 PM. To others, this may sound like a Black Mirror episode just before the plot twist makes the useful technology fully dystopic.</li><li id="d612" class="nd ne fq nf b go pm nh ni gr pn nk nl nm po no np nq pp ns nt nu pq nw nx ny pj pk pl bk">Considering these new ethical dilemmas we are being confronted with, do we also need to establish new rights? Should we all have the right to <em class="pi">lose control </em>and go against what is <em class="pi">good for us</em>? To make <em class="pi">our own decisions</em> even if they contravene our general preferences? What if we have opposing goals? And what do we do with the commercial interests of various actors offering the technologies or relying on the data they get from the ones offering it?</li><li id="81d3" class="nd ne fq nf b go pm nh ni gr pn nk nl nm po no np nq pp ns nt nu pq nw nx ny pj pk pl bk">What do we do with the actors, wanting to use these technologies for malevolent purposes? People have always been prone to deceit and had a weakness for using manipulation if it may help push their agenda. Aside from the commercial interests and the “danger” of getting extra-personalized ads, what happens if these systems start being used by the state to support an existing political system? (<a class="af nc" href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/mar/03/china-positive-energy-emotion-surveillance-recognition-tech" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Hello China.</a>) How do we fight manipulation if we don’t even know we are being manipulated in the first place?

The series will first try to exemplify why this is the case by comparing the scenario against the requirements of the GDPR, then the Data Act, and finally the upcoming AI Act. Hopefully, by analyzing these questions through the lens of the applicable legal framework we can identify some of the gaps and collectively think through how we can try closing them.</p><p id="e1c2" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">I wish us all good luck with it!</p></div></div></div></div>
