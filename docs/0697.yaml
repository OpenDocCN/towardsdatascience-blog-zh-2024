- en: In the previous parts of the series, I have explained the benefits of keeping
    track of machine learning experiments and have shown how to do that easily with
    DVC. One aspect that we have not covered in-depth so far in the series is hyperparameter
    tuning (HPT).

    adding or removing features, or fixing the odd bug, the number of those will probably
    still be manageable, as those require us to write code or carry out some analyses
    manually.

- en: However, this can easily get out of control when we consider hyperparameter
    tuning. In the previous parts, I showed that with the suggested setup, we can
    easily control the hyperparameters of the models from the `params.yaml` file.
    Additionally, by using DVC, we can easily keep track of the experiments by versioning
    that file. However, this still involves manually changing the hyperparameters
    according to our expertise or gut feeling. If we employ a procedure such as grid
    search, we might fit and evaluate our model thousands of times, each time with
    a different set of hyperparameters, all in just a…
