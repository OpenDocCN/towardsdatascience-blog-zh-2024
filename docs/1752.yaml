- en: With the amounts of data growing exponentially in the last few years, one of
    the biggest challenges became finding the most optimal way to store various data
    flavors. Unlike in the (not so far) past, when relational databases were considered
    the only way to go, organizations now want to perform analysis over raw data —
    think of social media sentiment analysis, audio/video files, and so on — which
    usually couldn’t be stored in a traditional (relational) way, or storing them
    in a traditional way would require significant effort and time, which increase
    the overall time-for-analysis.

    stored in a structured way, but without the necessity to design complex and time-consuming
    ETL workloads to move this data into the enterprise data warehouse. Additionally,
    what if half of the data professionals in your organization are proficient with,
    let’s say, Python (data scientists, data engineers), and the other half (data
    engineers, data analysts) with SQL? Would you insist that “Pythonists” learn SQL?
    Or, vice-versa?
