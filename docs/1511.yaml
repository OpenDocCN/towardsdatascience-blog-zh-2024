    Times, is an ultra-popular game that hundreds of thousands (or more) people play
    daily. I’ve personally been playing it for what feels like years now, and it has
    become a daily ritual.'

    puzzles. I know this has been done many times, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t
    something to learn along the way.

- en: The first thing I needed to source was a list of all the valid words. A simple
    Google search leads you to many Wordle dictionary sources. I tried a few different
    versions but ultimately ended up with one that contained just under 15,000 unique
    five-letter words. Note that this is not the official acceptable solution list
    but rather a long list of valid choices. This data comes from [GitHub](https://github.com/tabatkins/wordle-list)
