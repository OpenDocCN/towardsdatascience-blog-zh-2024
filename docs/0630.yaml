    SQL trainings. While those training sessions were never a top priority for me
    — they are among the projects that gave me the most satisfaction. When you start
    seeing someone getting comfortable with running their queries, finding the information
    they need by themselves, building dashboards, and more generally getting excited
    by this newly acquired skill; I don’t know — it just feels good.

    group to ask a pretty complex SQL question — and my reaction was the same as the
    one of Alfred when he nods to Bruce Wayne in “The Dark Knight Rises” (if you don’t
    have the reference — [here it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxUoCMUHoRM)).

    on running internal SQL training to teach entire non-technical (or at least not
    SQL-savvy) teams, so hopefully you can share the gift of knowledge in your organization
    and get similar joy as I got.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Upskilling needs**: Sometimes people in an organization can hit a ceiling
    because of their lack of SQL skills. A typical symptom of this is the apparition
    of convoluted processes that involve using multiple tools and spreadsheets to
    get to one final report. Granted, the solution is not always on the SQL side,
    but from experience, if you have one of those time-consuming multi-stage processes,
    and deep down you think that they’re got to be a better way to do what you are
    doing — most likely there is.'

  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    I found it very beneficial (for both the organization and the individual) to identify
    individuals with “adjacent skills” (i.e. people who are used to working with spreadsheets
    and data) and to offer to upskill them. You end up broadening the horizon of an
    individual while generating more value for the business.'

    above list is not exhaustive by any means; an argument could be made that this
    isn’t even mutually exclusive), it is important to be clear on what you want to
    achieve here. Depending on your goal, the way you’ll go about executing the training
    can differ greatly.

    in learning SQL, solely focused on SQL:'

    with strong intrinsic motivations for taking your training (e.g. you have a clear

    My general belief is that you can learn the key concepts of SQL in a very short
    amount of time but it will take you months/years to truly excel at it, and the
    sooner you start applying it to real-life problems, the faster you’ll get to a
    solid level. So the bulk of the program is spent on applying it to real-life problems,
    not on getting a basic understanding of SQL (that you can easily get on the amazing
    thing that is the internet).
