- en: Data ingestion is a crucial step in data engineering. Data engineers load huge
    amounts of data into various database systems for further transformation and processing.
    While dealing with relatively small amounts of data on staging we are in luck
    not running out of memory, working on production data pipelines with terabytes
    (or even petabytes) of records often turns into a real challenge. Existing ETL
    solutions offer automated data loading into a data warehouse we need and often
    have row-based pricing models. In this story, I would like to discuss how to create
    a bespoke data-loading solution for our pipelines to enable efficient data loading.
    We will take a better look into common data ingestion design patterns and typical
    ways to organise the process. We will reverse-engineer some of the most popular
    ETL solutions to see how data can be ingested without outages and losses efficiently.
    I will provide data-loading examples using Python libraries and tools available
    in the market for free to summarise my findings.
