    coaster the past few years have been, particularly for those working in tech.
    We went from record-breaking salaries to hiring freezes and layoffs, all within
    a matter of months. 2023 saw the second-highest number of tech layoffs on record,
    surpassed only by the dot-com crash in 2001\. While hiring in other sectors has
    remained resilient, the current tech job market is considered by many to be the
    worst since the turn of the century.

- en: The impact of multiple rounds of layoffs has led to an influx of tech workers
    applying for a smaller number of open roles. Couple this with the immensely unpopular
    return-to-office mandates imposed by many large employers, and just about everyone
    is looking for a new job. This has led to increased competition for fewer roles,
    with salaries and perks that appear to be on the decline. Employers can afford
    to be pickier, and the interview process has become longer and more complex.

- en: Applicant tracking systems and AI resume screeners have become the norm, creating
    a loop where it’s easy to apply to hundreds of jobs, but almost impossible to
    get your resume seen by a real person. Many of these vacancies may not even be
    ‘real’ jobs, with some companies posting positions that will never be filled.
