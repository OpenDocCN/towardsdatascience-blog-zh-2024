- en: How come John, with fewer years of experience, is promoted quicker than Mark,
    who has been in the company even before John went to University and is doing so
    much heavy lifting? Why does Sarah get the most promising projects while Ben,
    proposing so many ideas, is still on the bench?

    was undeservingly getting ahead in their careers while I was doing my best and
    yet not receiving the due attention.

- en: It took me some time to realize that careers never progress in straight lines,
    except in rare cases. And while in the most simplistic and fair world, the ones
    who do most of the work must be promoted, in real life it rarely works this way.

    You must sell it to the right people at the right time and market it well. If
    any of the components is lacking, getting to the next level could be challenging.
    The sooner you crack what it takes to be promoted, the easier it will be.
