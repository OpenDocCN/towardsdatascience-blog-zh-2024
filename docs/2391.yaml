    their position to their peers. Martin is still the harshest, most negatively biased
    judge. Noelia is still the most positively biased judge.

    don’t matter; any dance couple would be scored statistically fairly. But if the
    intra-panel biases don’t cancel, then there might be an unfair advantage present.

    that in small sample distributions (both panels have 10 data points) we commonly
    find a larger variance than the variance in its corresponding population distribution.
    However as the number of samples in the sample distributions increases, its parameters
    approach the value of the population distribution parameters (i.e mean and variance).
    This might be why the T-test fails to provide evidence that the panel biases are
    different, i.e. due to high variance.

    skewing low. We saw that Martin Ojeda was positively biased towards the worst
    and best performing dance couples by “pulling up” their scores and compressing
    mid-range dancers. Overall, his score distribution was far lower than all other
    judges. There were examples of judges that gave more typical scores and those
    that gave very generous scores (when compared to their peers).'

    judges on Panel 1 ranked as providing negative bias in scoring and most judges
    on Panel 2 ranked as providing positive bias in scoring. Consequently, Panel 1
    had an overall negative bias and Panel 2 had an overall positive bias in scoring
    dance competitors.
