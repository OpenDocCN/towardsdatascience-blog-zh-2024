- en: Delivering products with a team can sometimes be challenging, and if you are
    the team leader, it is your responsibility to work through those challenges and
    still have a successful project. This can be particularly demanding in consulting
    data science projects, where collaboration with client resources is essential.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition, when delivering end-to-end data science solutions, the need for
    close integration with client infrastructure, access to data, and frequent stakeholder
    feedback means you will typically work with a cross-functional team. This team
    may include business analysts, data scientists, DevOps engineers, data engineers,
    project coordinators, and domain experts. Each member brings unique skills and
    perspectives, but they also come with their own sets of challenges.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The key to navigating these issues lies in an understanding of individual team
    members capabilities, weaknesses and strengths, proper planning and a focus on
    goal achievement. As the team leader, you must be agile and adapt your plans based
    on the strengths and weaknesses of your team, but also sometimes evaluate your
    own behavior, to see how your own actions are perceived. Below, I explore some
    common team challenges in data science projects and offer some key takeaways to
    ensure successful project delivery.

    misunderstandings and lack of commercial insight to low productivity and disengaged
    stakeholders. Effective intervention often requires a combination of reflection,
    introspection, adaptive planning, one-on-one meetings and hands-on leadership.
    Here, I discuss specific challenges I have encountered and the strategies I employed
    to address them successfully.

- en: C**hallenge:** On one of my earlier projects, I was put in charge of a couple
    of data scientists that were struggling to deliver on a project. They had built
    an algorithm that was giving the opposite answer to what they were expecting.
    In this case their model predicted that churn would decrease as price increased.
    The consulting partners on the project were not impressed, and needed a viable
    solution that the client could accept.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I**ntervention:** My first course of action was to establish what we intuitively
    should expect from the algorithm. Then, I immersed myself in the data preparation
    and pipeline. (I totally support the common wisdom that data scientist spends
    80% of their time cleaning and prepping data, and only 20% on generating insights.)
    This helped me discover that the issue was caused by how the data was being prepared
    and transformed from the source data, what data was included in the model and
    what other assumptions they made during the modelling process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to trying to **lead by example** and being hands on with the data,
    I also had frequent **one-on-one meetings** with the data scientist. These meetings
    let me clarify my expectations and better understand why they had gone down the
    wrong path with regards to modelling and data. Furthermore, I provided feedback
    on how we could course correct and get back on track. It was also important to
    constantly remind the data scientists about the **end goal** we were trying to
    achieve with the project.

- en: 'C**hallenge**: As is often common with data science and data engineering projects
    there are a lot smart people involved. Usually this is great, but sometimes good
    ideas can get in the way of delivering on your goal. I have often seen data scientists
    — and I myself have been guilty of this — delve too deep into a given problem
    and perhaps slightly loosing focus on what we are trying to achieve. This issue
    becomes extra acute in a hectic project setting, where we face budget, time and
    resource constraints.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On one occasion, I tasked a data scientist with developing a model for predicting
    churn, however he got stuck on the details and kept going down an analysis path
    that was not fruitful — despite not making significant gains. The data scientist
    was very rigorous in his approach and had difficulty taking a more pragmatic view
    of the situation. In this case we were also looking for a connection between churn
    and price, however the way the data was structured, and the algorithms that were
    being applied were not conducive to the end goal.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This challenge doesn’t only apply to team members, and as team leader you yourself
    can also easily fall into this trap. On a recent project, I was working a business
    case and was determined I had a great solution for approximating the ROI of our
    project. It was rigorous, bottom up and didn’t require any wild assumptions to
    be able to show our case. However, after working on it for a few days it turned
    out it was way too time consuming and complex for what we really needed. They
    client didn’t fully understand the methodology and it was clear we needed a simpler
    and more intuitive approach.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I**ntervention:** In both cases, the solution was **introspection and reflection**
    on outcomes and use of time. Regarding the situation with the data scientist,
    I had **one-on-one meetings** with him to align on what we needed to achieve and
    deliver. What our **end goal** was. And for myself, by listening to feedback from
    my team and reflecting on my time consumption and progress, I was able to course
    correct and adjust the approach using a simpler technique that still met our objectives
    and allowed us to quantify the ROI of our project.

    when initially planning a project. However, as a consultant, you are often required
    to make development plans that integrate client personnel — despite not being
    able to assess their productivity beforehand. Various factors, such as being overloaded
    with projects or dealing with personal issues, can contribute to lower productivity.
    Beware of making overly detailed plans without understanding the available resources,
    as this can be a trap.'

    scientist FTEs (full time equivalents), 1 business analyst FTE and one data engineer
    FTE that would help me deliver the project. Based on this I tried to plan out
    how we might be able to deliver the project within the given timeframe. However,
    when time came to deliver it turned out one of my data scientists FTEs had a couple
    of weeks planned leave, and there were no one to replace him. It also turned out
    that the data engineer FTE didn’t really deliver and wasn’t able to produce the
    level of output we needed for the project.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'I**ntervention**: The situation above was resolved by having **short planning
    cycles** and quickly adapting to changing conditions. I directed one of our more
    productive data science FTEs to pick up the slack and became very **hands-on**
    myself. This flexibility would have been difficult with longer, less adaptable
    plans.'

    the client side that manages the project internally. This will typically be a
    person who either will own the end product you are building or someone whose role
    it is to manage projects internally and knows how to help the project move forwards.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Usually, it’s great to have someone on the client side who can contribute and
    help drive the project — especially when you need to align with multiple stakeholders.
    But sometimes you end up with a disengaged or uncooperative manager that doesn’t
    respond to emails and becomes more of a bottleneck than a help. For data science
    projects, where you ideally want frequent feedback, this can be problematic.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'I**ntervention**: Get **regular meetings** into their calendar. If you are
    used to weekly meetings with other managers, consider ramping that up to two meetings
    a week instead. Even if they don’t respond to emails, at least it is not long
    between **in-person catch ups**. If all else fails, another strategy can also
    be to use other channels to connect with the client. On one of my projects we
    had a consulting partner, who was not directly involved in the day-to-day operations
    of the project, reach out directly to the CMO on the client side and prompt the
    project manager to take more action.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Again, this is also a situation where **reflection and introspection** might
    be beneficial. Why is the project manager is behaving the way he is, is there
    anything about your own behavior that could have prompted it? Perhaps you did
    something or presented something in a way that rubbed off the wrong way? Try a
    **one-on-one** meeting to iron out any misunderstandings and align the focus on
    the **end goal** of the project.

    we discussed above have a lot in common with the original principles underlying
    the agile software development movement. In the “12 Principles Behind the [Agile
    Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)” we find a clear emphasis on a “*preference
    to the shorter timescale…* ”, and also ideas regarding reflection “*…reflects
    on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.*”
    Additionally, there is also a focus on meeting and talking with people: “*The
    most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development
    team is face-to-face conversation.*” Since agile was originally created as a method
    for software teams to improve their development processes in response to the prevailing
    waterfall methodology, it makes sense that many of its principles also apply to
    data science projects.'

- en: In many of the larger data science projects I have been involved in, the end
    goal has been to implement some kind of end-to-end machine learning system into
    the client architecture. This could be anything from custom-made pricing solutions
    to a fully fledged customer management platform. For example, if you are working
    on a price sensitivity algorithm that is going into the end customer pricing function,
    frequently evaluate whether your efforts and research is really advancing the
    end goal of the project.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In most of my projects, I have had positive experiences with taking a hands-on
    approach and working in the details with team. Leading by example is effective
    because it builds trust and respect. When leaders demonstrate the behavior and
    work ethic they expect from their team members, it sets a clear standard and motivates
    others to follow suit.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Leading by example can be especially important when you have low productive
    team members. Also, it lets you be more flexible in your planning and it’s easier
    to jump in whenever parts of the development need more attention. Ultimately,
    I believe leading by example helps create a culture of integrity, collaboration,
    and mutual support.

    due to the personalized communication and individual focus they provide. These
    meetings create a space for deeper understanding between managers and team members,
    allowing for tailored support and guidance on complex tasks. This is extra beneficial
    when you are a consultant and don’t know all the team members.

    from the team leader. Working with new people can be challenging, especially when
    coming from different countries and cultures. For example, I am from Norway, where
    direct and informal communication is common. This contrasts with the UK, where
    communication tends to be more subtle and polite.

- en: I have personally experienced times when I was too focused on the end goal,
    assuming everyone was on the same page, without stopping to coordinate with the
    team. Additionally, I sometimes find myself becoming too technical when explaining
    difficult subjects. If team members don’t understand, they can feel excluded and
    frustrated, and you might come across as a know-it-all or arrogant. This is particularly
    challenging in data science, where complex topics often need to be explained quickly.
