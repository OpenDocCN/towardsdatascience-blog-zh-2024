- en: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized the way we extract
    information from text and interact with it. However, despite their impressive
    capabilities, LLMs face several inherent challenges, particularly in areas such
    as reasoning, consistency, and information’s contextual accuracy. These difficulties
    come from the probabilistic nature of LLMs, which can lead to hallucinations,
    lack of transparency, and challenges in handling structured data.

- en: This is where Knowledge Graphs (KGs) come into play. By integrating LLMs with
    KGs, AI-generated knowledge can be significantly enhanced. Why? KGs provide a
    structured and interconnected representation of information, reflecting the relationships
    and entities in the real world. Unlike traditional databases, KGs can capture
    and reason about the complexities of human knowledge, ensuring that the outputs
    of LLMs come from a structured, verifiable knowledge base. This integration leads
    to more accurate, consistent, and contextually relevant outcomes.
