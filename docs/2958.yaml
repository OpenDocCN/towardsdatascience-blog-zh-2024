    work pretty much like the human brain — yet with quite some substantial differences
    that scientists are now starting to clarify.**'

- en: 'The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has spurred considerable interest
    in their potential to mirror the cognitive processes of the human brain. These
    complex computational systems demonstrate increasingly sophisticated capabilities
    in language processing, reasoning, and problem-solving, raising the intriguing
    question of whether they might operate using principles similar to those governing
    the human mind. I have indeed covered this idea before a couple of times, particularly
    in the context of the “Chinese room argument” and also in drawing parallels between
    how LLMs process text and how we humans learn to speak at the same time as we
    interact with the world and develop reasoning abilities from our daily experiences:'
