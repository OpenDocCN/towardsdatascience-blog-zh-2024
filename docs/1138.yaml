    used threading techniques but wants to try it in the future, there is one concept
    we can’t bypass. That is the thread safety. It refers to many different kinds
    of subtle bugs that are particularly caused by multi-threading. While we get benefits
    from running tasks concurrently in multiple threads, thread safety must always
    be kept in mind to avoid those bugs.

- en: Out of all the typical multi-threading-related bugs, race condition is a very
    subtle and annoying one. It may not easily happen if there are not too many threads
    running in parallel, which makes it more difficult to troubleshoot. However, it
    is also a bug that can be avoided if we really understand the reasons under the
    hood.

    In Python, the GIL makes it relatively more robust compared to most of the other
    programming languages, but it still could happen. Under certain circumstances,
    the race condition may not happen in Python, but I’ll find a way that guarantees
    to reproduce this bug and explain the mechanisms in detail.
