- en: Almost three years have passed since Russia invaded Ukraine’s territory on February
    24th, 2024\. This bloody war has destroyed or somehow affected dozens of thousands
    of families on both sides of the conflict. There is plenty of evidence across
    the internet shedding light on human suffering and pain brought by this war, one
    of the main sources of data being aerial and space imagery.

- en: Many private and military high-resolution space sensors are monitoring this
    region to obtain crucial information about troop movement, infrastructure, and
    environment near-real time. Unfortunately, this kind of data is often not available
    to a regular user, like we are, but a great amount of other satellites pass over
    Ukraine daily, so we could try to extract some meaningful information from free-access
    datasets and have a look at what’s going on there.

    lights radiance*** after the beginning of the war and see if there is a decline
    of this value in contrast, before/after the beginning of the war. This short investigation
    will be focused on three major cities in Ukraine: **Kiev**, **Kharkov,** and **Odessa**.'

    onboard, which is perfect for our purposes. This data is distributed with daily
    temporal resolution and ~500 m spatial one. But since we don’t want to deal with
    at least 365*3 files to produce the analysis, instead we’ll investigate *monthly
    average composites* with atmospheric corrections. [This data product](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/NOAA_VIIRS_DNB_MONTHLY_V1_VCMSLCFG#description)
    is distributed by Google Earth Engine (GEE) with free access, so no data downloading
    is required.

    with a bunch of polygons each resembling a Ukrainian region.'

    if the night time light radiance after the beginning of the war was anomalous,
    we need to know the values before. So we will be working with the whole time frame
    available: from **2012–01–01** to **2024–04–01**. Data before 2022–02–01 will
    be considered as **«a norm»** and everything after will be subtracted from this
    norm, hence, representing a **deviation (anomaly)**.'

    we need to collect **monthly night time lights radiancemaps** between 2022–02–01
    and 2024–04–01 and **average monthly night time lights radiance** *(in the form
    of time series)* for each region. The best way to do that is to iterate through
    a list of GEE images and saving a *.csv* and *.npy* files as the result.

    three time series. By analysing anomalies (not the actual time series) we tried
    to exclude seasonal component (change in night time lights radiance cause by snow).
    So arguably, all the negative anomalies we see should be related to the drone/missile
    attacks.

    in January of 2023 and 2024, whereas Odessa almost avoided any negative anomalies
