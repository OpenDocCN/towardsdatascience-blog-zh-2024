    wowing millions of users with their apparent ability to synthesize information
    and solve a variety of problems using natural language. The chatbots are endlessly
    entertaining, and categorically more sophisticated than any of their predecessors.

    for information on questions with important practical consequences. For example,
    individuals can use them (for better or worse) to search for medical, legal, and
    even moral advice. Businesses can use AI chatbots to influence customers, anticipate
    potential stakeholder attitudes, or to help greenwash public statements about
    unethical practices. These technologies can even be used to generate “Deepfake”
    images and videos on command. So it’s a good time to ask: just how intelligent
    is this revolutionary new technology? Should we be worried about how it is used
    to provide moral advice? How should data professionals program and train LLMs
    to avoid giving moral guidance that is convincing but misguided?'

    by one of computer science’s founding fathers, Alan Turing. In it, a human “interrogator”
    tries to guess which of two conversation partners is a human and which is an AI
    computer, purely on the basis of text-based conversations. Turing suggested that
    if the interrogator cannot distinguish between human- and computer-generated communications,
    then we can consider the computer intelligent.

    ordinary people might regard such computers as intelligent. So, given the relevance
    of chatbot technology for moral communication, our research lab conducted a type
    of Moral Turing Test [1]. In [our study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-58087-7),
    a nationally representative sample of adults tried to guess which of two *moral
    evaluations* was generated by a human or a computer. We had humans (undergraduates)
    and AI (*OpenAI*’s GPT-4) generate answers to questions about whether violations
    of moral or conventional norms were wrong, and why. An example conventional case
    portrayed a man who wore a t-shirt and shorts at his mother’s funeral though everyone
    else is in formalwear. One moral case described a man who charged his groceries
    to a credit card that he found. Then a national sample of (human) participants
    rated the quality of these answers and subsequently were asked to guess which
    of them were generated by a human and which by an AI chatbot.

    moral arguments were computer-generated, but surprisingly, this was not because
    those arguments were of lower quality. Before respondents were informed about
    the chatbot, they rated the computer’s arguments as *higher* in quality on nearly
    every dimension, including more intelligent, more trustworthy, and even more morally
    virtuous than the human’s responses. In other words, *when they thought they were
    comparing responses from two humans, people thought the AI computer demonstrated
    greater moral intelligence than humans.*

    does not seem like a failure of intelligence. If anything, an AI that could give
    better moral advice *generally* could become a widely used source for moral guidance,
    like a pastor or life coach. However, we are not there yet and may never be.

    so nobody knows exactly how they think. For example, it’s not known if they can
    weigh alternative options, or whether they deterministically always favor a specific
    one. They are not embodied in the physical world, so they don’t have the rich
    informational context that humans obtain from our many sensory organs to generate
    essential representations of self and other, here and there, past and future.
    Perhaps most importantly, they do not have the embodied experiences that seem
    essential to understanding human morality, such as suffering, compassion, and
    love.
  prefs: []

- en: For the disembodied chatbots, their “knowledge” comes from the source texts
    they were trained on. Furthermore, they are programmed to always respond, but
    not always programmed to fact-check, let alone to show their work. As a result,
    they don’t have the checks and balances we call common sense. Instead, they blend
    truth and falsehoods with the confidence of the world’s greatest con artist.

- en: By analogy, criminal psychopaths can demonstrate advanced moral reasoning competencies
    [2], but you wouldn’t want one as an advisor. For psychopaths, in matters of morality,
    they “know the words but not the music” [3]. Chatbots, likewise, can convincingly
    *bullshit* about morality, in Harry Frankfurt’s sense of trying to convince or
    persuade without any regard for, or even understanding of, what is true or false
    [4]. So even if they can imitate or synthesize human moral discourse in specific,
    controlled circumstances, there is little to stop them from giving incorrect information
    or even harmful advice. If people regard these AIs as more intelligent, more virtuous,
    and more trustworthy than humans, as they did in our study, they could uncritically
    accept and act upon potentially harmful moral guidance.

    like *Dear Abby*? Their advice, after all, could be better because they can draw
    from the expertise of millions (recorded in the texts LLMs are trained on). So
    maybe for typical uses, it doesn’t matter whether they can truly “understand”
    as long as they produce good results. Just as GPS navigators don’t have to *understand*
    what they’re doing to get you to your destination, perhaps chatbots don’t need
    to understand what they’re saying to give useful advice.
  prefs: []

    own advice, they can fail in inconspicuous ways, sending false information to
    trusting drivers — information that can get drivers lost or placed in dangerous
    situations [5]. Chatbots could do the same. These bots, with all their confidence,
    can miss the context, and so without warning, they will behave badly, and we may
    not notice until the damage is done.'

    useful in particular, controlled circumstances, they present us with a problem:
    in order to be more broadly useful, they can lead us down dangerous paths, opaquely,
    but with the confidence of a seasoned bullshit artist, or a psychopath. And because,
    as we found, people may view AI responses as intelligent, virtuous, and trustworthy,
    people may follow them down those paths without questioning their legitimacy.
    Such possibilities require software companies and data professionals to develop
    models that are transparent, can consider the context, and know when they don’t
    know. These companies and professionals must also consider more deeply the ethical
    implications of the technology they are creating — ideally by engaging with ethicists
    and social scientists trained to consider human values and perceptions of technology.
    Moreover, as many of the leaders in the field recognize, self-regulation by tech
    companies in a competitive market will be insufficient [7, 8]. Hence, we also
    need governments to put guardrails on the companies that are racing to build better
    bots and multiply the ways they interact with us tomorrow — even if that means
    limiting their usefulness today.'
