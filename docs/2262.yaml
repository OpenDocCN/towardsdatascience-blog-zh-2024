    The doctor did a quick examination and concluded there was nothing wrong; the
    eyes were just getting worse with old age.

    out she had a retinal detachment, and the delay in treatment caused permanent
    damage.

    further tests, there would have been a chance they all come back negative and
    it’s nothing after all. But the cost of being wrong in that case would have only
    been a waste of time and some medical resources, not permanent damage to an organ.
