    light conversations since the 1960s, and personal assistants conversing in human
    voices have been sold for a while. Not a big deal. Human appearances are in the
    eyes of human observers.
  prefs: []

    and I chat, we assume that the same words mean the same things because we have
    seen the same world. If we talk about chairs, we can point to a chair. The word
    “chair” refers to a thing in the world. But a chatbot has never seen a chair,
    or anything else. For a chatbot, a word cannot possibly refer to a thing in the
    world, since it has no access to the world. It appears to know what it is talking
    about because it was trained on data downloaded from the web, which were uploaded
    by people who know what they are talking about. A chatbot has never seen a chair,
    or a tree, or a cow, or felt pain, but his chats are remixes of the chats between
    people who have. Chatbot’s words do not refer to things directly, but indirectly,
    through people’s words. The next image illustrates how this works.

    Many theories of meaning have been developed in different parts of linguistics
    and philosophy, often subsumed under the common name *semiotics*. While they differ
    in many things, they mostly stick with the picture on the left, of meaning as
    a relation between a signifying token, say a written or spoken word, and a signified
    item, an object, or a concept. While many semioticists noted that words and other
    fragments of language are also referred to by words and other fragments of language,
    the fact that the entire process of language production can be realized within
    a self-contained system of references, as a whirlwind of words arising from words
    — as *demonstrated* by chatbots — is a fundamental, unforeseen challenge. According
    to most theories of meaning, chatbots should be impossible. Yet here they are!

    was his most prominent pupil. To a modern eye, the illustration seems to be showing
    Zeno disproving Parmenides’ claims against the possibility of movement by moving
    around. An empiric counterexample. For all we know, Zeno did not intend to disprove
    his teacher’s claims and neither Parmenides nor Plato (who presented Parmenides’
    philosophy in eponymous dialogue) seem to have noticed the tension between Parmenides’
    denial of the possibility of movement and Zeno’s actual movement. Philosophy and
    the students pacing around were not viewed in the same realm. (Ironically, when
    the laws of motion were finally understood some 2000 years later, Parmenides’
    argument, popularized in Zeno’s story about Achilles and tortoise, played an important
    role.)

    chatbot researchers and their companies, could just as well be built and trained
    by an alien spaceship parked by the Moon. They could listen in, crawl our websites,
    scrub the data, build neural networks, train them to speak on our favorite topics

    body. One of the first steps into modern science was his realization that living
    organisms were driven by the same physical mechanisms as the rest of nature, i.e.
    that they were in essence similar to the machines built at the time. One thing
    that he couldn’t figure out was how the human body gives rise to the human mind.
    He stated that as the *mind-body problem*.

    as a process implementable in machines, and his results proving that that process
    can simulate our reasoning and calculations, suggested that the mind may be arising
    from the body as a system of computational processes. He speculated that some
    version of computation was implemented in our neurons. He illustrated his 1947
    research report with a neural network.

    Bletchley Park. That part of the story seems well-known. When the war ended, he
    turned down positions at Cambridge and Princeton and accepted work at the National
    Physics Laboratory, hoping to build a computer and test the idea of machine intelligence.
    The 1947 memo contains what seems to be the first emergence of the ideas of training
    neural networks, and of supervised and unsupervised learning. It was so far ahead
    of its time that some parts seem still ahead. It was submitted to the director
    of the National Physics Laboratory Sir Charles G. Darwin, a grandson of Charles
    Darwin and a prominent eugenicist on his own account. In Sir Darwin’s opinion,
    Turing’s memo read like a “fanciful school-boy’s essay”. Also resenting Turing’s
    “smudgy’’ appearance, Sir Darwin smothered the computer project by putting it
    under strict administrative control. The machine intelligence memo sank into oblivion
    for more than 20 years. Turing devoted the final years until his death (at the
    age of 42, by biting into a cyanide-laced apple!) to exploring the computational
    aspects of life. E.g., what determines the shape of the black spots on a white
    cow’s hide? Life always interested him.

    tablet menus together with their native tongues. Networks absorb our thoughts,
    reprocess them, and feed them back to us, suitably rearranged. We absorb information,
    reprocess it, and feed it back to computers. This extended mind processes data
    by linking human and artificial network nodes. Neither the nodes nor the network
    can reliably tell them apart. “I think, therefore I exist” may be stated as a
    hallucination. But this extended mind solves problems that no participant node
    could solve alone, by methods that are not available to any of them, and by nonlocal
    methods. Its functioning engenders nonlocal forms of awareness and attention.
    Language engines (they call themselves AIs) are built as a convenience for human
    customers, and their machine intelligence is meant to be a convenient extension
    of human intelligence. But the universality of the underlying computation means
    that the machine intelligence subsumes the human thinking, and vice versa. The
    universality of language makes intelligence invariant under implementations and
