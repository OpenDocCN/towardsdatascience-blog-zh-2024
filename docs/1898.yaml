    until idle browsing on cute owl memes led me to this [website](https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/international-owl-awareness-day/).
    Then, as we recently found a lovely owl family in our garden, I thought I would
    check them out on Wikipedia — and was stunned to see that there are [254 owl species
    recorded on Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_owl_species), our favorite
    free open-access knowledge source. The only logical next step was to turn this
    into a data visualization to better understand the international owl landscape.

    their Wikipedia profiles. Then, I will use text matching and the NetworkX graph
    analytics library to extract the similarity network of the owl species, which
    I will then visualize. This way, we will have a visual representation of the owl
    species, which makes it much easier to interpret the relationship between different
    species.

    easily adaptable to any other topic we would like to cover and turn into a knowledge
    graph relying on the publicly available Wikipedia database.
