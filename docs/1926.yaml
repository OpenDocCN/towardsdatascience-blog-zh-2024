- en: You can't be more wrong than assuming the user would ask the LLM the perfect
    questions. Rather than directly executing, what if we refine the user's problem?
    That's query translation.

- en: We built an app that lets users query through all the documents my company ever
    produced. These include PPTs, project proposals, progress updates, deliverables,
    documentation, etc. It was remarkable because many such attempts in the past fell
    short. Thanks to RAGs, this time, it was very promising.

    a small, selected batch of staff. But what we noticed wasn't very exciting to
    us.

- en: This was expected to be a game-changer in the way we work. But most users tried
    the app only a few times and never used it later. They quit the app as if it were
    a toy project for school kids.

- en: The logs showed satisfactory results. However, we spoke to the real users who
    used the app to determine the real issue. The lessons we learned led us to think
    about *query translation techniques* to overcome ambiguity in user inputs.
