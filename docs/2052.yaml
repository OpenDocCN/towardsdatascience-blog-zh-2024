- en: 'The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is essential in graph theory as it provides an
    efficient means to compute the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a
    graph. This classic dynamic programming algorithm is widely applicable beyond
    its traditional use in theoretical network analysis. It works by reading in a
    matrix that describes which pairs of nodes are connected by a single edge, and
    outputting the minimal number of edges connecting every possible pair of nodes:'

- en: A set of nodes (red) linked by edges (light green lines) and then 2 examples
    of the distances (numbers of links between pairs of nodes, in dark green with
    dashed lines) calculated by the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. The direct links are
    encoded in a matrix called the “adjency matrix” whose elements are 1 (nodes linked)
    or 0 (not linked). The output from the algorithm if a matrix of equal size but
    containing the distances between all nodes as the minimal numbers of edges separating
    any two of them. This and all other figures were produced by the author.

    tons of applications; for example in optimizing communication networks, analyzing
    contacts in social networks, or, as I will cover here, in parsing molecular structures
    — at the core of many tasks in cheminformatics and structural bioinformatics.

- en: In this post I will show you how the Floyd-Warshall algorithm can be employed
    to compute bond distances between atoms in a molecule, or said in a different
    way, the minimal number of bonds separating every possible pair of atoms. Hopefully,
    my example will not only showcase the algorithm’s application in chemistry but
    also inspire you to use it for other applications in…
