    Brain team introduced **Transformer** which rapidly outperformed most of the existing
    approaches in deep learning. The famous **attention** mechanism became the key
    component in the future models derived from Transformer. The amazing fact about
    Transformer’s architecture is its vaste flexibility: it can be efficiently used
    for a variety of machine learning task types including NLP, image and video processing
    problems.'

- en: The original Transformer can be decomposed into two parts which are called **encoder**
    and **decoder**. As the name suggests, the goal of the encoder is to encode an
    input sequence in the form of a vector of numbers — a low-level format that is
    understood by machines. On the other hand, the decoder takes the encoded sequence
    and by applying a language modeling task, it generates a new sequence.

    famous models deriving their parts from the original Transformer are called [**BERT**](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/bert-3d1bf880386a)
