    but concerns are growing that the misuse of these powerful tools is leading to
    a reproducibility crisis in science and its technological applications. Let’s
    explore the fundamental issues contributing to this detrimental effect, which
    applies not only to AI in scientific research but also to AI development and utilization
    in general.**'

- en: Artificial Intelligence, or AI, has become an integral part of society and of
    technology in general, finding every month several new applications in medicine,
    engineering, and the sciences. In particular, AI has become a very important tool
    in scientific research and in the development of new technology-based products.
    It enables researchers to identify patterns in data that may not be obvious to
    the human eye, and other kinds of computational data processing. All this certainly
    entails a revolution, one that in many cases materializes in the form of game-changing
    software solutions. Among tens of examples, some such as [large language models
