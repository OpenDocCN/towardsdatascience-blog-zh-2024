class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">In the process of writing my talk for the AI Quality Conference coming up on June 25 in San Francisco (<a class="af nb" href="https://www.aiqualityconference.com/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">tickets still available</a>!) I have come across many topics that deserve more time than the brief mentions I will be able to give in my talk. In order to give everyone more detail and explain the topics better, I’m starting a small series of columns about things related to developing machine learning and AI while still being careful about data privacy and security. Today I’m going to start with <strong class="ne fr">data localization</strong>.</p><p id="b8ed" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">Before I begin, we should clarify what is covered by data privacy and security regulation. In short, this is applicable to “personal data”. But what counts as <strong class="ne fr">personal data</strong>? This depends on the jurisdiction, but it usually includes PII (name, phone number, etc.) PLUS data that could be combined together to make someone identifiable (zip code, birthday, gender, race, political affiliation, religion, and so on). This includes photos, video or audio recordings of someone, details about their computer or browser, search history, biometrics, and much more. <a class="af nb" href="https://gdpr.eu/eu-gdpr-personal-data/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">GDPR’s rules about this are explained here</a>.</p><p id="3400" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">With that covered, let’s dig in to data localization and what it has to do with us as machine learning developers.</p><h1 id="7860" class="ny nz fq bf oa ob oc gq od oe of gt og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot bk">What’s Data Localization?</h1><p id="23a1" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go ou ng nh gr ov nj nk nl ow nn no np ox nr ns nt oy nv nw nx fj bk">Glad you asked! Data localization is essentially the question of what geographic place your data is stored in — if you localize your data, you are keeping it where it was created. (This is also sometimes known as “data residency”, and the opposite is “data portability”.) If your dataset is on AWS S3 in us-east-1, your data is actually living, physically (inasmuch as data lives anywhere), in the United States, somewhere in Northern Virginia. To get more precise, AWS has several specific data centers in Northern Virginia, and you can get their exact addresses online. But for most of us, knowing the general area at this grain is sufficient.</p><h1 id="effb" class="ny nz fq bf oa ob oc gq od oe of gt og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot bk">Why should I care where the datacenter is? Isn’t the cloud just ‘everywhere’?</h1><p id="d204" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go ou ng nh gr ov nj nk nl ow nn no np ox nr ns nt oy nv nw nx fj bk">There are good reasons to know where your data lives. For one thing, there can be real physical speed implications for loading/writing data to the cloud depending on how far you and your computer are from the region where the datacenter is located. But this is likely not a huge deal unless you’re doing crazy high-speed computations.</p><p id="f4d2" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">A more important reason to care (and the reason this is a part of data privacy), is that data privacy laws around the world (as well as your contracts with clients and consent forms filled out by your customers) have rules about data localization. Regulation on data localization involves requiring personal data about citizens or residents of a place to be stored on servers in that same place.</p><p id="8433" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">General caveats:</p><ul class=""><li id="1ce1" class="nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx oz pa pb bk">It doesn’t always apply to all kinds of data (financial data is more often covered)</li><li id="32c8" class="nc nd fq ne b go pc ng nh gr pd nj nk nl pe nn no np pf nr ns nt pg nv nw nx oz pa pb bk">It doesn’t always apply to all kinds of businesses (tech companies are more often covered)</li><li id="b0a4" class="nc nd fq ne b go pc ng nh gr pd nj nk nl pe nn no np pf nr ns nt pg nv nw nx oz pa pb bk">It may be triggered by a government request, or it might be automatic (see Vietnam)</li><li id="454e" class="nc nd fq ne b go pc ng nh gr pd nj nk nl pe nn no np pf nr ns nt pg nv nw nx oz pa pb bk">Sometimes there are ways you can get consent to move the data, sometimes not</li><li id="0979" class="nc nd fq ne b go pc ng nh gr pd nj nk nl pe nn no np pf nr ns nt pg nv nw nx oz pa pb bk">Sometimes you just need to initially store the data in country, and then you can move it around later (see Russia)</li><li id="6f30" class="nc nd fq ne b go pc ng nh gr pd nj nk nl pe nn no np pf nr ns nt pg nv nw nx oz pa pb bk">Sometimes you can store it outside the country of origin but there are limits on where else it can go (see EU)</li></ul><p id="c739" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">In addition, private companies sometimes impose data localization requirements in contracts, potentially to comply with these laws, or to reduce the risk of data breach or surveillance by other governments on the data.</p><p id="fa2c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">This means, literally, that you may be legally limited on the locations of data centers where you can store certain data, primarily based on who the data is about, or who the original owner of the data was.</p><h1 id="5e33" class="ny nz fq bf oa ob oc gq od oe of gt og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot bk">Example</h1><p id="b289" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go ou ng nh gr ov nj nk nl ow nn no np ox nr ns nt oy nv nw nx fj bk">It may be easier to understand this with a concrete (simplified) example.</p><ul class=""><li id="7ce8" class="nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx oz pa pb bk">You run a website where people can make purchases.

Data engineering would still have to pipe the data from Russian customers through a special path, but you could combine the data for training. However, because you didn’t, you’re stuck! Make sure that you know what permissions and authorizations your consent tool includes, so you don’t get in this mess.</p><h1 id="9c86" class="ny nz fq bf oa ob oc gq od oe of gt og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot bk">On the fly combination</h1><p id="8696" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go ou ng nh gr ov nj nk nl ow nn no np ox nr ns nt oy nv nw nx fj bk">Assuming it’s too late to do that, another solution is to have a compute platform that loads from different databases at time of training, combines the dataset in the moment, and trains the model without ever writing any of the data to disk in a single place. The general consensus (NOT LEGAL ADVICE) is that models are not themselves personal data, and thus not subject to the legal rules. But this takes work and infrastructure, so get your dev-ops hat on.</p><p id="27e7" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">If you have extremely large data volumes, this can become computationally expensive very fast. If you generate features based on this data but personal data about cases is still interpretable, then you can’t save everything together in one place, but will either need to save de-identified/aggregated features separately, or write them back to the original region, or just recalculate them every time on the fly. All of these are tough challenges.</p><h1 id="255a" class="ny nz fq bf oa ob oc gq od oe of gt og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot bk">De-identify and/or aggregate</h1><p id="8e5f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go ou ng nh gr ov nj nk nl ow nn no np ox nr ns nt oy nv nw nx fj bk">Fortunately, there’s another option. Once you have aggregated, summarized, or thoroughly (irreversibly) de-identified the data, it loses the personal data protections and you can then work with it more easily. This is a strong incentive for you not to be storing personal data that is identifiable! (Plus, this reduces your risk of data breaches and being hacked.) Once the data is no longer legally protected because it’s no longer high risk, you can do what you want and carry on with your work, saving the data where you like. Extract non-identifiable features and dispense with identifiable data if you possibly can.</p><p id="d31c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">However, deciding when the data is sufficiently aggregated or de-identified so that localization laws are no longer applicable can sometimes be a tough call, because as I described above, many kinds of demographic data are personal because in combination with other datapoints they could create identifiability. We are often accustomed to thinking that when PII (full names, SSNs, etc) are removed, then the data is fine to use as we like. This is not how the law sees it in many jurisdictions! Consult your legal department and be conscientious about what constitutes risk. Ideally, the safest thing is when the data is no longer <em class="ph">personal data</em>, e.g. not including names, demographics, addresses, phone numbers, and so on at the individual level or in unhashed, human readable plaintext. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE.

If you have some personal data about people and no idea where it came from or where those people were located (and probably also no idea what consent forms they filled out), I think the safe solution is to treat it like this data is sensitive, de-identify the heck out of it, aggregate it if that works for your use case, and make sure it wouldn’t be considered personal or sensitive data under data privacy laws. But if that’s not an option because of how you need to use the data, then it’s time to talk to lawyers.</p><h2 id="0c99" class="pi nz fq bf oa pj pk pl od pm pn po og nl pp pq pr np ps pt pu nt pv pw px py bk">What if your company can’t afford datacenters all over the world?</h2><p id="094f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go ou ng nh gr ov nj nk nl ow nn no np ox nr ns nt oy nv nw nx fj bk">More or less, this is the same answer. Ideally, you’d get your consent solution in order, but barring that, I’d recommend finding ways to de-identify data immediately upon receiving it from a customer or user. When data comes in from a user, hash that stuff so that it is not reversible, and use that. Be extra cautious about demographics or other sensitive personal data, but definitely deidentify the PII right off. If you never store data that is sensitive or potentially could be reverse engineered to identify someone, then you don’t need to worry about localization. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE. TALK TO YOUR LEGAL DEPARTMENT.</p><h2 id="fb51" class="pi nz fq bf oa pj pk pl od pm pn po og nl pp pq pr np ps pt pu nt pv pw px py bk">Why do countries make these laws?</h2><p id="d210" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go ou ng nh gr ov nj nk nl ow nn no np ox nr ns nt oy nv nw nx fj bk">There are a few reasons, some better than others. First, if the data is actually stored in country, then you have something of a business presence there (or your data storage provider does) so it’s a lot easier for them to have jurisdiction to penalize you if you misuse their citizens’ data. Second, this supports economic development of the tech sector in whatever country, because someone needs to provide the power, cooling, staffing, construction, and so on to the data centers. Third, <a class="af nb" href="https://www.techpolicy.press/the-human-rights-costs-of-data-localization-around-the-world/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">unfortunately some countries have surveillance regimes on their own citizens</a>, and having data centers in country makes it easier for totalitarian governments to access this data.</p><h2 id="dc4f" class="pi nz fq bf oa pj pk pl od pm pn po og nl pp pq pr np ps pt pu nt pv pw px py bk">What can I do to make this hurt less as a data scientist?</h2><p id="9560" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go ou ng nh gr ov nj nk nl ow nn no np ox nr ns nt oy nv nw nx fj bk">Plan ahead! Work with your company’s relevant parties to make sure the initial data processing is compliant while still getting you the data you need. And make sure you’re in the loop about the consent that customers are giving, and what permissions it enables. If you still find yourself in possession of data with localization rules, then you need to either find a way to manage this data so that it is never saved to a disk that is in the wrong location, or deidentify and/or aggregate the data in a way so that it is no longer sensitive, so the data privacy regulations no longer apply.</p><h2 id="132f" class="pi nz fq bf oa pj pk pl od pm pn po og nl pp pq pr np ps pt pu nt pv pw px py bk">What are some of the major data localization laws I need to know about?</h2><p id="211a" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go ou ng nh gr ov nj nk nl ow nn no np ox nr ns nt oy nv nw nx fj bk">Here are some highlights, but this is not comprehensive because there are many such laws and new ones coming along all the time.

I know this can get dry, but I’ll reward you with a story. I once worked at a company where we had data localization provisions in contracts (not the law, but another business setting these rules), so any data generated in the EU needed to be in the EU, but we had already set up data storage for North America in the US.</p><p id="499c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">For a variety of reasons, this meant that a new replica database containing just the EU stuff was created, based in the EU, and we kept these two versions of the entire Snowflake database in parallel. As you may expect, this was a nightmare, because if you created a new table, or changed fields, or basically did anything in the database, you had to remember to duplicate the work on the other. Naturally, most folks did not remember to do this, so the two databases diverged drastically, to the point where the schemas were significantly different. So we all had endless conditional code for queries and work that extracted data so we’d have the right column names, types, table names, etc depending on which database you were pulling from, so we could do “on the fly” combination without saving data to the wrong place. (Don’t even get me started on the duplicate dashboards for BI purposes.) I don’t recommend it!</p><p id="b73f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">These regulations pose a real challenge for data scientists in many sectors, but it’s important to keep up on your legal obligations and protect your work and your company from liabilities.
