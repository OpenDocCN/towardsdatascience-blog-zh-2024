    quite a few [**evaluation metrics**](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/a-comprehensive-overview-of-regression-evaluation-metrics-6264af0926db),
    such as MSE, MAE, RMSE, MAPE, etc. What these metrics have in common is that they
    focus on point predictions.

    distributions instead of a single point. In that case, we need to use different
    metrics, which are not as commonly covered in data science blog posts.

    This time, I will walk you through another metric used to evaluate probabilistic
    forecasts — the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS).

    are on the same page. **Probabilistic forecasts** provide a distribution of possible
    outcomes. For example, while point forecasts would predict tomorrow’s temperature
    as exactly 23°C, a probabilistic model might predict a 70% chance the temperature
    will be between 20°C and 25°C.
