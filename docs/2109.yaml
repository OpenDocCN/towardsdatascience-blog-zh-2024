    to have a section devoted to it in a Data Science course. We are told that when
    presenting data, we should tell a story using the right graphs, gently guiding
    our audience.

    to make the audience understand the data analysis results is the least severe
    one. A presentation with mistakes will make the presenter appear sloppy at least,
    ignorant or deceitful at worst. It will eat away his or her credibility.

    referring to using the proper statistical analysis tools, or the appropriate machine
    learning algorithms. Maybe a better word is that a presentation should be “consistent”
    with itself. An element in a slide should not…
