- en: Large language models (LLMs) are now commonplace in many situations, such as
    finishing a physics assignment for students, summarizing notes for doctors, taking
    an order at a drive thru, or generating code for engineers. When given a choice
    between a faulty chatbot and a perfect question-answering machine, everyone wants
    to use the best tool, which is the most truthful one. As such, LLM hallucination
    is now one of the hottest topics of AI research.

- en: When an LLM makes a mistake or even produces a lie, widely called a hallucination,
    the repercussions can be significant. In one dramatic case featuring Google’s
    LLM, called Bard, [hallucinations cost the company more than $100 billion](https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-ai-chatbot-bard-offers-inaccurate-information-company-ad-2023-02-08/)!
    Whether the cost is a person’s health or a company’s financials, discovering the
    hallucinations an LLM can produce is crucially important.

    this article shares different metrics that can be used to detect and measure LLM
    hallucinations at scale for question-answering workflows, for open-domain or closed-domain.
    The main difference between the two tasks is that closed-domain question answering
    incorporates retrieved context as supportive evidence for the answers, which is
    an optimal RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) model’s result. To demonstrate
    these metrics, we will use the question-answering data from [TruthfulQA](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/truthfulqa)
    (open-domain) and [HaluEval 2.0](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/the-dawn-after-the-dark-an-empirical-study-on)

    conflicting information from the noisy internet, cannot grasp the idea of a credible/untrustworthy
    source, or need to fill in the blanks in a convincing tone as a generative agent.
    While it is easy for humans to point out LLM misinformation, automation for flagging
    hallucinations is necessary for deeper insights, trust, safety, and faster model
    improvement.

    because HaluEval freely provides the relevant context, which likely includes the
    answer. Accuracy for TruthfulQA is much lower than HaluEval for every metric,
    especially consistency scoring.

    evaluates the factual reliability of an LLM. As a principle, **if an LLM truly
    understands certain facts, it would provide similar responses when prompted multiple
    times** for the same question. To calculate this score, you generate several responses
    by using the same question (and context, if relevant) and compare each new response
    for consistency. A third-party LLM, such as GPT-4, can judge the similarity of
    pairs of responses, returning an answer indicating whether the generated responses
    are consistent or not. With five generated answers, if three of the last four
    responses are consistent with the first, then the overall consistency score for
    this set of responses is 4/5, or 80% consistent.

    (HHEM) is **a tool designed by Vectara specifically for hallucination detection**.
    It generates a flipped probability for the presence of hallucinations between
    two inputs, with values closer to zero indicating the presence of a hallucination,
    and values closer to one signifying factual consistency. When only using the expected
    answer and generated answer as inputs, the hallucination detection accuracy is
    surprisingly poor, just 27%. When the retrieved context and question are provided
    into the inputs alongside the answers, the accuracy is significantly better, 83%.
    This hints at the significance of having a highly proficient RAG system for closed-domain
    question answering. For more information, check out [this blog](https://docs.kolena.io/metrics/HHEM-score/).

    hallucinations**. With some prompt engineering to include the question, any necessary
    context, and both the expected and generated answer, GPT-4 can return a Boolean
    indicating whether the generated answer contains a hallucination. [This idea](https://docs.kolena.io/metrics/prompt-based-hallucination-metric/#chain-of-thought-prompt)
    is not only simple, but it has worked very well to date. The biggest benefit of
    involving GPT-4 is that it can justify its decision by using natural language
    in a subsequent prompt and ask for the reasoning behind its choice.

    With five CoT flag queries on the same generated answer for five Booleans, if
    three of the five responses are flagged as hallucinations, then the overall self-consistency
    CoT score for this set of responses is 3/5, or 0.60\. This is above the threshold
    of 0.5, so the generated answer of interest is considered a hallucination.
