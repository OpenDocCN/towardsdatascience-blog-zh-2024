    learn to get their first job in Data, and where they should learn them. This article
    is the distillation of the advice I have been giving aspiring data scientists,
    analysts, and engineers for the last 5 years.
  prefs: []

- en: This article is primarily geared towards self-taught data jockeys who are looking
    to land their first role in data. If you’re reading this article, odds are your
    first role will be as an analyst. Most of the entry level roles in data are analyst
    roles and I don’t regard data scientist or data engineering roles as entry level.
  prefs: []

    language.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Different jobs will require a different blend of these skills, and you can build
    an entire career out of mastering just one of the pillars, but almost all roles
    in data require at least a cursory knowledge of the four subjects.

    has been talking about the fabled “excel killer” and it hasn’t ever been found.
    You could have been part of a multi-team 6-month long effort to harmonize data
    from 7 databases, built them into the sexiest Tableau dashboard, and the first
    thing your stakeholders will ask you is how they can export it to excel.

    for aspiring analysts because it is a good introduction to working with more formally
    structured data and working with proper tabular data.

    a lot of the advanced features. If you learn excel you can quickly adapt to google
    sheets, and you can learn many of the basic spreadsheet functions on google sheets,
    but I don’t think it’s an adequate substitute for excel at this point.

- en: This is a tricky subject for aspiring analysts to learn because outside of a
    production environment it is hard to learn the nuances of working with databases
    beyond basic syntax. This is because most of the practice data sets are far too
    clean.
  prefs: []

    the amateur mistake of joining two tables on the FINANCING_ID column instead of

    or designed, but are rather organic accretions of data that build up over time,
    accrued via mergers and acquisitions and time constrained software engineers trying

    hire analysts will produce dashboards with either Power BI or Tableau (I’ve worked
    with a few others but these are the dominant players).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Like SQL, I wouldn’t suggest indexing too heavily in visualization until after
    you have a job, learning the basics is important, but much of the advanced functionality
    is best learned in a production environment.

    attention between the two.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If your primary experience in data is with Excel, Power BI will likely be more
    intuitive for you to work with. Once you learn to use one, you can easily adapt
    to learning another, and for most generalist analyst roles, hiring managers won’t
    care that much, as long as you know one of them.

    didn’t require me to know a scripting language, but that was some time ago and

    to define a function to detect whether a given string input is a palindrome (a
    word spelled the same way forwards and backwards). They then admitted they didn’t
    know how to define a function. I politely ended the interview there.

    you get an interview with a recruiter that you otherwise wouldn’t get), but I
