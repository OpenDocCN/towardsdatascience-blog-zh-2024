    topics and ideas. Drilling into the concepts surfaced by the broader framework
    is a substantial endeavor, and in this article, we continue our work by focusing
    on an AI Agent Capabilities Engineering Framework. The approach to this framework
    relies on a taxonomically oriented mindset, that extends concepts primarily rooted
    in cognitive and behavioral sciences.

    & technology development we have often used ourselves as the inspiration or model
    for what we are trying to build. A topical example of this in AI itself is the
    neural network which was inspired by the human brain. In an effort to build a
    framework for AI Agent Capabilities it seems natural then to turn to cognitive
    and behavioral sciences for inspiration, guidance and extension of useful concepts.
    Let’s first get a high-level grasp on what these sciences entail.

    encompassing areas such as psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, and artificial
    intelligence. It provides critical insights into how humans perceive, think, learn,
    and remember.

    and actions, often considering the behavioral interaction between individuals
    and their environments. It includes disciplines such as psychology, sociology,
    anthropology, and economics.

    heights, grounding our capabilities framework in cognitive and behavioral theories
    should give us a solid foundation to begin to meet those expectations and help
    us unlock a future where AI agents are equipped to perform complex jobs with human-like
    proficiency.

- en: Before we dive into the minutiae let’s consider on a high-level how we might
    categorize the so-called ‘capabilities’ that power the ‘actions’ our agents need
    to take in an effort to perform their ‘jobs’. I propose that in general they fall
    into the categories of Perceiving, Thinking, Doing and Adapting. From there we
    can move on to identifying example capabilities in these categories on a more
    granular level. Although the resulting framework is categorically cohesive, bear
    in mind that the implied relationships between granular capabilities and categories
    are approximate. In reality the capabilities are heavily intertwined throughout
    the framework and trying to model this multi-dimensionality does not feel particularly
    useful at this stage. Below is a visual representation of the major categories
    and sub-categories that make up the framework without the categorical alignments
    that you will see shortly.

    and allow for the expansion of these frameworks into the realm of embodied AI
    and robots, we incorporate concepts that would be applicable in these settings

    appropriately an overarching characteristic for a given agent or one of more of
    its capabilities. That said, autonomy is not necessarily a requirement that must
    be met for an agent to be effective in its given job(s).

    quite impressively, it falls far short of the human capabilities for such. In
    short, LLMs provide a not entirely reliable but powerful shortcut to enabling
    many of these capabilities. They represent a very consequential evolutionary step
    in intelligence and interaction technologies and their unprecedented adoption
    helps explain why there is so much excitement around the idea of Artificial General
    Intelligence (AGI). Although the definition of what it actually entails is the
    subject debate, if achieved, it could be the go to technology solution for enabling

- en: I hope you find the AI Agent Capabilities Engineering framework to be an insightful
    approach for defining your AI agents’ capabilities. By integrating concepts from
    cognitive and behavioral sciences, this framework aims to guide the development
    of the capabilities needed for AI agents to perform complex tasks. The framework
    is relatively dense and will surely evolve over time. The key takeaway at this
    stage is the mental model centered around Perceiving, Thinking, Doing, and Adapting.
    These four high-level concepts on their own provide a very robust foundation for
    organizing and developing Agent capabilities effectively.
