data. Empirical data, scraped and collected and stored by bots and humans alike. Artificial data, generated by models and simulations that are created and run by scientists and engineers. Even the opinions of executives and subject matter experts, recorded for later use, are data.</p><p id="eb68" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nx ny fq nz b go oq ob oc gr or oe of nk os oh oi no ot ok ol ns ou on oo op fj bk">To what end? Why do we spend so much time and effort gathering data? The clarion call of the data revolution has been the <strong class="nz fr">data-driven decision</strong>: the idea that we can use this data to make better decisions. For a business, that might mean choosing the set of R&amp;D projects or marketing pushes that will maximize future revenue. For an individual, it might simply mean an increase in satisfaction with the next car or phone or computer that they buy.</p><p id="6f06" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nx ny fq nz b go oq ob oc gr or oe of nk os oh oi no ot ok ol ns ou on oo op fj bk">So how then do data scientists (and analysts and engineers) actually leverage their data to support decisions? Most data-to-decisions pipelines start with <strong class="nz fr">Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</strong> — the process of cleaning and characterizing a dataset, primarily using statistical analysis and supporting graphs of the spread, distribution, outliers, and correlations between the many features. EDA has many virtues that build understanding in a dataset and, by extension, any potential decision that will be made with it:</p><ul class=""><li id="6169" class="nx ny fq nz b go oq ob oc gr or oe of nk os oh oi no ot ok ol ns ou on oo op ov ow ox bk">Identifying potential errors or flawed data, and ways to correct them</li><li id="3c75" class="nx ny fq nz b go oy ob oc gr oz oe of nk pa oh oi no pb ok ol ns pc on oo op ov ow ox bk">Identifying subgroups that may be under- or overrepresented in the dataset, to either be mathematically adjusted or to drive additional data collection</li><li id="620d" class="nx ny fq nz b go oy ob oc gr oz oe of nk pa oh oi no pb ok ol ns pc on oo op ov ow ox bk">Building intuition for what is possible (based on spreads) and common (based on distributions)</li><li id="922a" class="nx ny fq nz b go oy ob oc gr oz oe of nk pa oh oi no pb ok ol ns pc on oo op ov ow ox bk">Beginning to develop an understanding of potential cause-and-effect between the different features (with the permanent caveat that correlation does not equal causation)</li></ul><p id="9ebb" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nx ny fq nz b go oq ob oc gr or oe of nk os oh oi no ot ok ol ns ou on oo op fj bk">That’s a useful first step towards a decision! A well-executed EDA will result in a reliable dataset and a set of insights about <strong class="nz fr">trends</strong> in the data that can be used by decision makers to inform their course of action. To overgeneralize slightly, trend insights concern the frequency of items in the dataset taking certain values: statements like “these things are usually X” or “when these things are X, these other things are usually Y”.</p><p id="caba" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nx ny fq nz b go oq ob oc gr or oe of nk os oh oi no ot ok ol ns ou on oo op fj bk">Unfortunately, many real-world data-to-decisions pipelines end here: taking a handful of trend insights generated by data scientists with EDA and “throwing them over the wall” to the business decision makers. The decision makers are then responsible for extrapolating these insights into the likely consequences of their (potentially many) different courses of action. Easier said than done! This is a challenging task in both complexity and scale, especially for non-technical stakeholders.</p><figure class="mm mn mo mp mq mr mj mk paragraph-image"><div class="mj mk pd"><img src="../Images/a9d3ab2e3a26fb2c3854d3ea8ffdc2b6.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1090/format:webp/1*kWVAWw6Q9E4xq7nrYygixQ.png"/></div><figcaption class="mt mu mv mj mk mw mx bf b bg z dx"><em class="my">Data scientists often have to throw trends “over the wall” to people who make business decisions, with no visibility of how those decisions are made — or sometimes even what those decisions are! (Image created by author with Playground AI)</em></figcaption></figure><p id="8eee" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nx ny fq nz b go oq ob oc gr or oe of nk os oh oi no ot ok ol ns ou on oo op fj bk">If we want to make better decisions, we need to break down that wall between the data and the decision itself. If we can collect or generate data that corresponds directly to the choices or courses of action that are available to decision makers, we can spare them the need to extrapolate from trends. Depending on the type of decision being made, this is often straightforward: like a homebuyer with a list of all the houses for sale in their area, or an engineering company with models that can evaluate thousands of potential designs for a new component.</p><p id="dab0" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nx ny fq nz b go oq ob oc gr or oe of nk os oh oi no ot ok ol ns ou on oo op fj bk">Creating a decision-centric dataset requires a slightly different type of thinking than classic EDA, but the results are significantly easier to interpret and are therefore more likely to adequately support a decision. Instead of stopping with trends, our exploration needs to solve the <strong class="nz fr">needle in the haystack</strong> problem and find<strong class="nz fr"> the best single datapoint in the set</strong>, in order to complete the data-to-decision pipeline from end-to-end.</p><p id="6995" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nx ny fq nz b go oq ob oc gr or oe of nk os oh oi no ot ok ol ns ou on oo op fj bk">Welcome to the world of <strong class="nz fr">tradespace exploration</strong>.</p></div></div></div><div class="ab cb pe pf pg ph" role="separator"><span class="pi by bm pj pk pl"/><span class="pi by bm pj pk pl"/><span class="pi by bm pj pk"/></div><div class="fj fk fl fm fn"><div class="ab cb"><div class="ci bh ev ew ex ey"><h2 id="4f6d" class="mz na fq bf nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw bk">FROM DATA-INFORMED TO DATA-DRIVEN</h2><p id="aa67" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nx ny fq nz b go oa ob oc gr od oe of nk og oh oi no oj ok ol ns om on oo op fj bk">Before we jump into the details of tradespace exploration, let’s ground this discussion with an example decision. Needing to buy a car is a decision many people are familiar with, and it’s a good example for a handful of reasons:</p><ul class=""><li id="c3e0" class="nx ny fq nz b go oq ob oc gr or oe of nk os oh oi no ot ok ol ns ou on oo op ov ow ox bk">It’s high-consequence and worth the effort to “get it right”. Cars are expensive, (ideally) last a long time, and most people use them every day! Anyone who has ever bought a lemon can tell you that it’s a particularly challenging and frustrating setback.</li><li id="5f05" class="nx ny fq nz b go oy ob oc gr oz oe of nk pa oh oi no pb ok ol ns pc on oo op ov ow ox bk">People care about multiple factors when comparing cars: price, reliability, safety, handling, etc. This isn’t a problem where you can simply pick the car with the highest horsepower and expect to be satisfied.</li><li id="f2f8" class="nx ny fq nz b go oy ob oc gr oz oe of nk pa oh oi no pb ok ol ns pc on oo op ov ow ox bk">There are usually a lot of choices.

A flat data file like this one, where each item/row corresponds to a car listing described by a shared set of features/columns, is the most common format for publicly-available datasets. Then I would start with summarizing, finding problems, and cleaning the data to remove incomplete/outlier listings or inconsistently-defined columns. Once the data is clean, I would analyze the dataset with statistics or graphs to identify correlations between different variables.

Not so much! I can’t actually buy the cars in the dataset since they are historical listings. If any are still active, I don’t know which ones because they aren’t indicated as such. I don’t have data on the cars that are actually available to me and therefore I still need to find those cars myself — and my EDA is useful only if the trends I found can then help me find good cars while I search a different dataset manually.</p><figure class="mm mn mo mp mq mr mj mk paragraph-image"><div class="mj mk po"><img src="../Images/114f2e43c3e52605d7a36268d5d0d9fa.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1214/format:webp/1*07H-HJxJSnSjTGA_kFdefw.png"/></div><figcaption class="mt mu mv mj mk mw mx bf b bg z dx"><em class="my">When trends about past data are thrown “over the wall” to decision makers who are looking at current/future data, those trends are more difficult to leverage into a good decision.

Maybe I care about the number of passengers a car can carry (for practicality), its engine cylinders (for fun), its odometer mileage (for longevity), and its safety rating (for… safety).</li></ul><p id="a0e1" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nx ny fq nz b go oq ob oc gr or oe of nk os oh oi no ot ok ol ns ou on oo op fj bk">This simple outline gives us direction on how to then collect data during the <strong class="nz fr">Generate</strong> step.

Am I done collecting data? No — this dataset includes my alternative variables (manufacturer, model, year, VIN) and my resources (price) but is missing two of my benefits: passenger count and safety rating. I will need to supplement this dataset with additional data, or I won’t be able to accurately judge how much I like each car. This requires some legwork on the part of the analyst to source the new data and properly match it up with the existing dataset in new columns.</p><p id="22fc" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nx ny fq nz b go oq ob oc gr or oe of nk os oh oi no ot ok ol ns ou on oo op fj bk">Fortunately, the alternative variables can act as “keys” to cross-reference different datasets.

It is considered best practice for MATE to start with as large a set of alternatives as possible, to not preemptively constrain the decision. By going to the websites of nearby car dealerships and searching for their used inventory, I can add more cars to my dataset as additional rows. Depending on how many cars are available (and my own motivation), I could possibly even automate this process with a web scraper, which is how data collection is often performed at-scale. Remember though: I still need to have data for at least the alternative variables, resources, and benefits for each car in the dataset. Most dealership listings won’t include details like safety ratings, so I will need to supplement these with other data sources in the same way as before.</p><p id="03b3" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nx ny fq nz b go oq ob oc gr or oe of nk os oh oi no ot ok ol ns ou on oo op fj bk">At this point, I have my data “haystack” and I’m almost ready to start the Explore layer and look for that “needle”.

Well… yes and no. You can (and should!) perform EDA on a MATE dataset — cleaning potential errors or weirdness out of the dataset remains relevant and is especially important if data was collected via an automated process like a web scraper. And the goals of building intuition for trends in the data are no different: the better we understand how different criteria are related, the more confident we will become in our eventual decision.

The technical answer is that most people display “incomplete ordering” [11] between benefits and resources — a fancy way of saying that stakeholders will often be unable to definitively state whether they prefer a low-cost-low-benefit alternative or a high-cost-high-benefit alternative since neither is strictly superior to the other. Incidentally, this is also why it is very difficult to “solve” a decision by optimizing a function: in practice, decision makers generally like to see a <strong class="nz fr">set</strong> of alternatives that vary from low-cost-low-benefit to high-cost-high-benefit and judge for themselves, and this ends up being more reliable than combining benefits/costs into one value model.

I’ll just add a filter that removes white cars, save a new Pareto set and:</p><figure class="mm mn mo mp mq mr mj mk paragraph-image"><div class="mj mk py"><img src="../Images/0701e1de70625f342257b35947535736.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/format:webp/1*ekKWM9PVA8glktl-AtDJSw.png"/></div><figcaption class="mt mu mv mj mk mw mx bf b bg z dx"><em class="my">Filtering the tradespace once more to remove white cars, and saving a new Pareto set with a green squares blaze.

Now the best car in my budget is a silver 2009 Volkswagen Touareg. I lost one passenger compared to the Chrysler (6 to 5) which is not ideal, but the utility of this car is nearly as high thanks to its significantly lower odometer (14,000 to 158). It’s practically new and it only costs $3500!</p><p id="dbea" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nx ny fq nz b go oq ob oc gr or oe of nk os oh oi no ot ok ol ns ou on oo op fj bk">We found it: the needle in the haystack.

Tradespace exploration can be the “one step beyond” EDA that pushes a decision from data-informed to truly data-driven. But this short example only scratches the surface of what we can do with MATE.</p><p id="e3df" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nx ny fq nz b go oq ob oc gr or oe of nk os oh oi no ot ok ol ns ou on oo op fj bk">The MATE framework supports many additional types of data and analysis.
