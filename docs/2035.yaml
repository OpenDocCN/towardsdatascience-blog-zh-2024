- en: The most common request I’ve received from (AI consulting) clients is “*Build
    me a custom chatbot*.” While this is a great solution to some problems, it is
    far from a cure-all. In this article, I share three alternative ways businesses
    can use AI to generate value in the context of sales. The approaches span Generative
    AI, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning.

- en: Large language models (LLMs) have taken over the business world, and now every
    company is trying to use Generative AI. Although tools like ChatGPT are clearly
    powerful, it is not clear how businesses can reliably use this technology to **drive
    value**.

- en: For most businesses I’ve interacted with, “*using AI*” means building a chatbot,
    co-pilot, AI agent, or AI assistant. However, as the initial excitement about
    these solutions wanes, organizations are realizing the key challenges of building
    systems around LLMs.

- en: A central challenge is that LLMs are inherently unpredictable (even more so
    than traditional machine learning systems). Therefore, it is **not easy to get
    them to solve a specific problem predictably**.
