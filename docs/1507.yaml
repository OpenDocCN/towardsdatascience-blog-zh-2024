    tech to predict user participation in Zooniverse. Zooniverse is an online citizen
    science platform that allows non-scientists to contribute to specific fields,
    such as planetary exploration. Zooniverse has contributed to the publication of
    [over 100 papers](https://www.zooniverse.org/#:~:text=Our%20researchers%20have%20used%20the,that%20encourage%20many%20fascinating%20discoveries.)**.**
    In practical settings, citizen scientists proved that agricultural runoff in the
    UK was increasing pollution in UK rivers b[eyond safe thresholds.](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/30/english-rivers-pollution-sewage-agriculture-uk#:~:text=4%20months%20old-,83%25%20of%20English%20rivers%20have%20evidence%20of,pollution%20from%20sewage%20and%20agriculture&text=Eighty%2Dthree%20per%20cent%20of,take%20place%20in%20the%20UK.)
