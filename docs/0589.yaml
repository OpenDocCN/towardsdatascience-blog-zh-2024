    packages. You have to understand what the algorithm is actually doing first and
    foremost and know when and why to use it. The process to learn what the algorithms
    are doing is by studying the underlying maths.

    a high standard. That’s just the brutal truth. However, the maths needed is not
    a Ph.D. or even a master’s degree level. Most of it is covered in the later years
    of high school and the first couple of years of many undergraduate courses.

    and exactly the things you should study, along with useful resources.
