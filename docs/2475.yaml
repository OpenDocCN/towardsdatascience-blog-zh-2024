    for harnessing the power of AI to perform day-to-day tasks. Their growing popularity
    comes with a nontrivial amount of confusion, though—from what they actually are
    (the anthropomorphic term itself doesn’t help in that regard) to how and in what
    contexts they can be used effectively.

- en: This week, we’ve put together a strong lineup of recent articles that will help
    beginners and experienced practitioners alike to find their bearings around this
    topic and to make informed decisions about adopting agents in their own workflows.
    From their core traits to broader questions on reasoning and alignment, these
    posts cover agents from a technical and practical perspective, while placing them
    in the context of AI’s growing footprint in our daily lives. Let’s dive in!

    if we could build fully autonomous AI agents, how often would they be the best
    thing for users?” [Julia Winn](https://medium.com/u/80bc2c74c4e9?source=post_page---user_mention--c71229f53ece--------------------------------)
    explores the fundamental traits of agents, adds much-needed nuance to our understanding
    of what they are—and what they aren’t, and proposes a spectrum of agentic behavior
    as a framework to assess their suitability for specific tasks.'

    way. [Tula Masterman](https://medium.com/u/ce8c2ab0804a?source=post_page---user_mention--c71229f53ece--------------------------------)’s
    lucid overview focuses on how reasoning is expressed through tool calling, explores
