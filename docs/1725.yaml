    what they are and how you use them, and show you how to implement them using examples
    written in PySpark.

- en: Incidentally, when I talk about PySpark, I just mean that the underlying language
    being used when programming with Spark is Python. The OG language for development
    using Spark ***was*** Scala, but with Python’s meteoric rise in popularity, it’s
    now the main language people use when programming in Spark even though Spark itself
    is written in Scala.

- en: If you haven’t used or heard of Spark before, the TL;DR is that it is a powerful
    tool for processing and analysing large amounts of data quickly. It’s a distributed
    computing engine, designed to handle big data tasks by breaking them into smaller
    pieces and working on them in parallel. This makes it much faster and more efficient
    than many other methods, especially for complex tasks like data analysis, machine
    learning, and real-time data processing.

    cater to different aspects of data processing and analysis, including components
    for Machine Learning, SQL operations and handling…
