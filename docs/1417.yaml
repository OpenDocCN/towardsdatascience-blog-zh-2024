- en: In single-cell genomics data, where we profile tens of thousands of features
    in individual cells, be it at the level of gene expression, protein expression,
    or some other genome-wide modality, we often strive to derive a high-level summary
    of the data. This can be achieved through various means such as differential gene
    expression, where we perform statistical testing between clusters to cell populations
    to determine which genes are statistically significant across clusters, or data
    visualization, where we compress the multiple dimensions brought on as a consequence
    of having multiple features measured into 2 or 3 dimensions to make sense of it.

- en: One effective way of making sense of single-cell data is converting it into
    a graph — i.e., a tuple of nodes and edges. In this scenario, nodes are cells,
    and edges define connections between cells. This tuple-based data structure provides
    a flexible approach of grouping together cells, exploring the relationships between
    different types of cells (e.g., diseased cells from normal cells, different stages
    of development), and visualizing the overall structure of the dataset.
