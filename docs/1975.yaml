    but it is always complicated and delicate, especially when you have to manipulate
    time series data.

- en: 'A **time series** is an event that occurs over time. For example, the total
    daily sales of a company. The company sells products and, at the end of the day,
    calculates the total sales: what were the total sales for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
    and so on. This is a time series.'

- en: Does the value of the time series â€” in this case, the total sales on Tuesday
    â€” influence the value of the time series on Wednesday, the following day? This
    is a question that someone analyzing time series will likely want to answer.

- en: To address this question, I need to analyze the data, check the assumptions
    of the techniques I will adopt, consider the time factor, and often apply the
    concept of **lag**, moving the data in time at some point. In other words, it
    is never a simple task, but it is a high-level task, as it helps solve numerous
    business problems across various segments.
