- en: For many physical systems, properly modeling their dynamical behaviors lays
    the foundation for system understanding, forecasting, and control. Mathematically,
    **ordinary differential equations** (ODEs), which describe the rate of change
    of system states over time, are widely used to characterize the dynamical systems.
    Correspondingly, many analytical and numerical solvers have been developed that
    can effectively solve the ODEs, thus allowing us to portray the system state trajectory.

    knowledge of the ODEs. For many real-world, complex systems, unfortunately, this
    requirement is rarely fulfilled: for some, we may know the functional form of
    the ODEs but don’t know the associated model **parameters**; for others, even
    their **functional form** is hidden from us. Without explicit equations, using
    ODE solvers for dynamical system modeling is out of reach.'
