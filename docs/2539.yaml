- en: Traditionally, methodologists are those who study research methods, both qualitative
    and quantitative. Modern day methodologists (methodologist-analysts, methodologist-scientists,
    and methodologist-engineers) are the wielders of multiple approaches to complex
    problems. They are also conversant in the tools and technologies available for
    implementation, though often work best alongside true specialists in these areas
    (such as cloud architects, software developers, or data engineers).

    methodology as a discipline](/emerging-tech-is-nothing-without-methodology-44df8cbafd85).
    With the right personality and the proper technical or analytical exposure, the
    methodologist can be the most impactful technical role in an organization.

    software engineers, why would you hire a methodologist? Better yet, who would
    even self-identify as a methodologist? ([I would argue this guy is](https://medium.com/@TarikDzekman/my-career-change-to-ai-from-ux-b1ed6690c09a).)

    mean multiple non-obviously related entries on a resume often spanning both qualitative
    and quantitative roles, and multiple industries. We’ve already accepted this notion
    in the ecology of team building — a successful team is an interdisciplinary one
    that promotes diversity of thought. I would argue that the same is true for the
    mind.'

    A good methodologist understands that while there probably isn’t a ‘correct’ answer,
    there likely is a ‘best’ answer. They also use a brief but structured process
    to explore multiple approaches before selecting one. This mindset shift is slight
    but crucial: searching for the optimal fit as opposed to the right answer.'

    Methodologists won’t be bothered by attending conferences outside of their field,
    so long as the content isn’t surface. Whether it’s a thinking strategy, an art
    form, a statistical method, or a programming routine, nearly everything can be
    useful when solving complex problems in truly creative ways. Often it is classes,
    workshops, lectures, activities, or conversations that encourage the mind in uncharacteristic
    directions that are most useful in creative problem solving. Methodologists often
    think and write in analogies.'

    a career, it is common to see the methodology mindset extend beyond the original
    discipline and further into the ordering of the surrounding world. Methodologists
    are likely to pick up elements of business, finance, and the public-facing components
    of the industry because of that inherent curiosity and ability to learn. For this
    reason, a methodologist often excels at bringing all the pieces together for a
    program, a portfolio, or a business. In other words, methodologists are able to
    bring multiple competing objectives into alignment around an outcome — objectives
    of customers, investors, end users, and other stakeholders. The alignment of objectives
    mentality is about ‘optimal’, not ‘correct’. And it is often akin to completing
    a 1000 piece jigsaw puzzle using the pieces from many other 1000 piece jigsaw
    puzzles.'

    medici effect*, credited to Frans Johansson. Methodologists solution at the intersection
    of disciplines. They serve as the connective tissue across operational barriers
    of an organization; the nodes with the highest betweenness centrality [within

    They are often buried in esoteric higher education programs, or deeply embedded
    in their industries. Ultimately, methodologists require broad analytical and/or
    technical exposure, but the title itself speaks more to a mindset than a resume,
    likely better identified in a culture fit interview than a technical one.

    of thought and skill.** Conceptual diversity and analytical breadth is developed
    in a variety of ways, from formal education programs and bootcamp courses, to
    on-the-job experience, and extensive reading and conversation. “Applied” academic
    programs tend to produce better methodologists than theoretical ones as they are
    more focused on practical application of solutions. For example, my degrees are
    (loosely) in: linguistics (BA), analytics (MS), and simulation (PhD).'

    notions of culture and individual versus collective, grouping, subgrouping, and
    transmission. It equally filled my technical brain with ideas of formalized structure
    for seemingly unstructured things (i.e., speech) which conceptually translates
    directly to working on data problems. Linguistics even provided me my first contact
    with coding in computational linguistics.

    broad reach across many methods and their applications (i.e., geospatial modeling,
    time series analysis, cognitive thinking strategies, [social network analysis](https://www.insna.org/),
    gamification, statistics). The latter took me deeply into a very specific field
    (agent-based modeling and simulation), one that intersected well with my professional
    work as a data scientist and solution architect which, in its own right, provided
    much on-the-job learning.

    training into on-the-job learning of AI implementation when broad applications
    of machine learning (ML) came to my industry. This, paired with a Project Management
    Professional (PMP) certification, earned me the title of technical program manager
    of AI implementation programs. Given this, I *should* have pursued a Ph.D. in
    ML or Deep Learning, but instead chose computational social science (CSS). This
    took my new technical knowledge and applied it to the domain of analysis where
    my journey started: linguistics and sociocultural study. ML is highly relevant
    in the field of CSS, but the simulation is the target of study, not the ML algorithm
    itself.'

    my main focus area at the time — from a Master’s degree to a profession, from
    a profession to a Ph.D. These tangential explorations serve to expand one’s knowledge
    base while connecting to an individual’s cornerstone skills or domains. It is
    this increased connectivity — [not too unlike a graph](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/entity-resolved-knowledge-graphs-6b22c09a1442)
