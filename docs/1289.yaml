- en: R**einforcement learning** is a domain in machine learning that introduces the
    concept of an agent who must learn optimal strategies in complex environments.
    The agent learns from its actions that result in rewards given the environment’s
    state. Reinforcement learning is a difficult topic and differs significantly from
    other areas of machine learning. That is why it should only be used when a given
    problem cannot be solved otherwise.

    standard approaches, their elegance lies in the fact that they do not require
    any knowledge about the environment’s dynamics. This aspect makes all the difference
    because in real life we do not normally know all possible transition probabilities
    between states.

    highly recommended to be familiar with the main concepts of reinforcement learning
    as well as the policy improvement methods introduced in the first two articles
    of this series.'
