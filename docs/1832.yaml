- en: When I was younger, I heard about *The Office* all the time and kept bumping
    into scenes of it on the internet. I decided to give it a shot â€” it seemed like
    a cool show after all â€” but being in university and never having worked in an
    office, I didnâ€™t get it and gave up after one or two episodes. Some years later,
    after having worked in a corporate office for a while, I randomly found it on
    Netflix and decided to give it another shot. I was star-struck! After watching
    a few episodes, I even felt as though I might be working for Dunder Mifflin. Every
    character seemed relatable and intimate, and it was kind of a relief to see that
    the existential dread of the average 9â€“5 job is a universal experience. I loved
    it!

    seemed foolish and often bothered everyone, yet we donâ€™t actually get to hate
    him because heâ€™s such a sweet and nice guy deep down. If you really think about
    it, everyone in the show is a bit of an asshole. Michael, Dwight, and Angela for
    sure, but over time, you also realize that Jim was quite annoying, and even Phyllis
    or Pam are salty atâ€¦
