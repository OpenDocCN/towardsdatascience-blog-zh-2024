- en: Data observability and its importance have often been discussed and written
    about as a crucial aspect of modern data and analytics engineering. Many tools
    are available on the market with various features and prices. In this 2 part article,
    we will focus on the open-source version of Elementary, one of these data observability
    platforms, tailored for and designed to work seamlessly with dbt. We will start
    by setting up from zero and aiming to understand how it works and what is possible
    in different data scenarios by the end of part 2\. Before we start, I also would
    like to disclose that I have no affiliation with Elementary, and all opinions
    expressed are my own.

    daily report. If you are comfortable with this part already and interested in
    checking different types of data tests and which one suits bests for which scenario,
    you can directly jump into part 2 here:'

    engineer are positive, as to how my team conceives the results. Our team uses
    Elementary for automated daily monitoring with a self-hosted elementary dashboard.
    Elementary also has a very convenient cloud platform…
