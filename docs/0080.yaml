    a target field is a rough indicator of the degree of influence of the target on
    the source. We note here, though, that not all citations are equal and subject
    to various biases. Nonetheless, meaningful inferences can be drawn at an aggregate
    level; for example, if the proportion of citations from field *x* to a target
    field *y* has markedly increased as compared to the proportion of citations from
    other fields to the target, then it is likely that the influence of *x* on *y*
    has grown.

- en: To facilitate reflection on the papers we cite from various fields, we created
    [an online public tool](https://huggingface.co/spaces/jpwahle/field-diversity)
    to compute the amount of cross-field citations for individual papers and even
    sets of papers (e.g., author profiles, proceedings). Insert a Semantic Scholar
    or ACL Anthology URL, and the tool computes various metrics such as the most cited
    fields, the citation field diversity, and so on. Or upload a PDF draft, and the
    bibliography will be parsed and linked to their corresponding fields.
