- en: A/B Testing is very powerful. I like this kind of experiment because it gives
    us the power to compare outcomes and determine if something is performing better
    than another.

- en: A/B Testing has a specific type that adds the *time* component, which is the
    **Before and After A/B Test**. On that test, the comparison is between the situation
    of a given subject before and after an intervention.

    can show that ad to a treatment group and compare the results to a control group
    that did not see the ad. The difference before and after the ad would indicate

    and treatment groups before the intervention.

    and machine learning, it is possible to simulate what would have happened with
