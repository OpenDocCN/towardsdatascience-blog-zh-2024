    flagged a ballistic missile launch from the United States directed toward to the
    Soviet Union.

    the duty officer on shift at a secret EWS control center outside Moscow, received
    the warning on his screens. He had only minutes to decide whether to flag the
    signal as legitimate and alert his superior.'

- en: The EWS was specifically designed to detect ballistic missile launches. If Petrov
    had told his boss that the signal was real, the Soviet leadership would have been
    well within the bounds of reason to freak out. To complicate matters, the Cold
    War had reached a terrifying crescendo in 1983, boosting the probability in the
    minds of the Soviets that the signal from the EWS was, in fact, the real thing.
