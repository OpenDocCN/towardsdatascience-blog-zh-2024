    It’s taught in any statistics class and it’s one of the metrics implemented in
    [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#regression-metrics).'

    In the [notes for his course at Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/mreg/15/lectures/10/lecture-10.pdf),
    **Professor Cosma Shalizi claims that *R-Squared* is useless**.

    sight of the positives. In this article, I will explain what is wrong with *R-Squared*,
    and suggest a modification that makes it fully reliable.

- en: To grasp what is the problem with *R-Squared*, we first need to understand its
    meaning. And I mean **the deeper meaning, not the sloppy definitions that can
    be found in most resources**.

    designed to forecast the selling price of a house.
