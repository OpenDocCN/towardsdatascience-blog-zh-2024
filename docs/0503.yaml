- en: Whether you’re applying to your first internship to running a multidisciplinary
    team of analysts and engineers, data science careers come with their own specific
    set of challenges. Some of these might be more exciting than others, and others
    can be downright tedious—that’s true in any job, of course—but we believe in framing
    all of these potential drawbacks as opportunities to deepen your knowledge, expand
    your skill set, and consider new viewpoints.
