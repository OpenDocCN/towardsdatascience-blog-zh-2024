- en: Deep learning (DL) is the only way to solve the problem. That’s the implicit
    assumption in much of the research I read. I’m always tempted to agree. But, that’s
    probably because my PhD would be useless otherwise.

    of problems where machine learning can help. These include monitoring air quality,
    estimating soil moisture, assessing crop health and tracking natural disasters.
    It is also true for my area of research — monitoring coastal erosion.

- en: The coastline is long! The length means we need to automate some tasks to effectively
    monitor it all. At the same time, noise caused by factors like land development,
    cloud cover and offshore winds and swells means traditional, deterministic methods
    can fail. It is handling variations like this where machine learning thrives.
