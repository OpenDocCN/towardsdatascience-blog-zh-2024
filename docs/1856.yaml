    I have become convinced that successful research project planning is kind of an
    art. It’s unlikely that any single planning framework can meet all needs. Unlike
    development projects, which typically start with a clear understanding of both
    the goal and the method—“*I know what I want and I know how to do it”—*research
    projects usually begin with a clear goal but no defined method: *“I know what
    I want but I have no idea how to do it”*.'

    involved. In this post, I will share several practical ideas on research project
    planning, aiming to provide a perspective that makes navigating the uncertainties
    of research more manageable and less frustrating.

    the starting point, encompassing all prior data about the project. This includes
    initial beliefs, expected hypotheses, promising preliminary experiments, relevant
    findings from the literature and other knowledge. Point B is the desired project
    outcome, a set of goals whose achievement marks project success. The space between
    points A and B is filled with uncertainty, which must be carefully navigated.
    An effective project plan addresses this uncertainty by strategically placing
    milestones to guide the path. Each milestone should not only answer specific research
    questions but also refine our understanding of the project’s trajectory.

    was calculated on planet A with the best possible precision, but there are no
    guarantees it’s correct. However, along its journey, the spacecraft can encounter
    navigation stations that help adjust its trajectory. If there are enough stations
    and they function well, the chances of correcting the trajectory and reaching
    star B are high.

    dataset to train models on an augmented dataset. Some straightforward milestones
    would be: implementing a synthetic data generation pipeline, generating synthetic
    datasets, and then training and evaluating models using this augmented data. While
    it may be tempting to jump straight to data generation, this approach is not always
    advisable as it can be time-consuming and might not yield meaningful results.
    Adding an initial evaluation of the potential improvement in model performance
    by incorporating real data from the same or a closely related domain could be
    beneficial. If the potential improvement appears promising, proceed with synthetic
    data generation. This milestone can reveal whether the addition of data leads
    only to marginal improvements and may also provide insights into which aspects
    of the data should be prioritized to maximize utility. The initial choice between
    these two project trajectories may appear crucial for the project’s success.'

    deep your plan should be. A project without any planning will be more like a random
    walk with only an accidental probability of getting to the right place. On the
    other hand, a too detailed plan is likely to appear useless as most of its parts
    will not happen in reality.

    knowledge, you imagine the most probable outcomes, branch decisions for specific
    results, and then explore them further. Here is where the tradeoff comes into
    play: it is possible to grow this tree of beams as big as your imagination, but
    on the other hand, it is possible to start acting with an incomplete tree and
    update it on the fly. This creates a planning-execution tradeoff. The longer the
    time horizon for planning, the more uncertainty appears. It is usually tempting
    to over-plan, but reality is often more complex, and there is a high chance that
    many plan branches will become obsolete.'

    tree of “ifs” and “elses”, creating tables of model architectures and hyperparameters
    to evaluate, along with sources of additional data and numerous hypotheses I wanted
    to test during the project. When the time came to execute, I encountered an unexpected
    result at the first step — it appeared that the initial approach did not fit the
    inference latency constraints, and I had to completely reconsider the project’s
    approach. All that detailed planning turned out to have little in common with
    reality.

    out of time or budget. We usually hope for the best-case scenario, but life tends
    to be more complicated. Many unexpected situations may arise and influence our
    plans. This is extremely common and, to the same degree, often ignored. How often

    new subway station, or a rocket launch, has been delayed or its budget doubled?

    Kahneman described the case of planning the development of a decision making course.
    During the preparation, all colleagues were asked to estimate the time needed
    to finish the course (plan exercises, write a textbook, etc.), and the answers
    ranged from 1.5 to 2.5 years. Then he asked another colleague if he remembered
    similar projects and what their durations were. It turned out that for similar
    projects, only about 40% managed to finish, and for those that did, it took about
    7 to 10 years. Finally, the project was completed, and it took 8 years.

    reached a final stage that was running out of time. I had planned a “perfect”
    scenario for this stage, designed to fit the time constraints and accomplish the
    project goals. The main weakness of this plan was the assumption that everything
    would work flawlessly. However, in reality, everything that was not under direct
    control went wrong — one colleague get sick, the computation server went down
    for a week, and another colleague needed urgent extra days off. Consequently,
    the initial “perfect” plan fell apart, highlighting that relying on perfect conditions
    is not robust approach.

    and desired results may seem unreachable, at least at this moment. Trying to finish
    the project at some point may become similar to trying to ride a dead horse. At
    some points in the project, options for goal pivoting or even project termination
    should be considered. This is always a challenging task as we have already invested
    time and resources into the project. We are already strongly involved, and it’s
    tempting to think that the next idea may solve the problem and everything will
    be fine. In reality, that project-saving idea may never appear, or it may take
    years to find it (like the more than 10-year-long blue LED development). If your
    resources are not unlimited (which is likely the case), project termination or
    pivoting points should be considered.

    finding a solution or terminating it and spend resources in a different, potentially
    more promising direction. One of the most reliable approaches here is to apply
    time limits to your milestones: if some intermediate result is not achieved, take
    time to consider whether it is just a duration estimation error or a bigger problem.
    One compromise is pivoting. If the main goal of the project seems unreachable
    from a certain point, consider defining another still important goal that may
    be reachable from the results already gained.'

    However, while this plan is clearly in front of you, all the unexpected cases
    are unseen and almost impossible to anticipate. They are likely to affect the
    project, so be prepared for it. Embrace the unexpected challenges as integral
    parts of the process rather than disruptions. This mindset allows for flexibility,
