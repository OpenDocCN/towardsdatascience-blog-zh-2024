That’s significant to me because ChatGPT is only 1 month younger than my daughter. Just yesterday she successfully put a star shaped block into a star shaped hole, told me about how “yesa-day” she was sick and “bomited”, and told me she wanted to call her nanna on the phone. What has ChatGPT learned in those 2 years? It hasn’t learned to act in the real world, it can’t remember things that happened to it, and it doesn’t have desires or goals. Granted, with the right prompt it could output text that convincingly follows an instruction to express goals. But is that really the same thing? No. The answer is No.</p><p id="4d4a" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nj nk fq nl b go nm nn no gr np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe fj bk">Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT possess capabilities far beyond what my daughter will ever achieve. She won’t be able to communicate coherently in a wide range of languages, read as many books as exist in an LLM’s training data, or generate text as quickly. When we attribute human-like abilities to LLMs, we fall into an anthropomorphic bias by likening their capabilities to our own. But are we also showing an anthropocentric bias by failing to recognize the capabilities that LLMs consistently demonstrate? Let’s review the scorecard so far:</p><ul class=""><li id="dac7" class="nj nk fq nl b go nm nn no gr np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe of og oh bk">It’s true that an LLM doesn’t have memory — although we can simulate one by having it summarise past conversations and including that information in a prompt.</li><li id="6bfa" class="nj nk fq nl b go oi nn no gr oj nq nr ns ok nu nv nw ol ny nz oa om oc od oe of og oh bk">LLMs don’t have intrinsic goals — although they can be prompted to generate text that sounds convincingly goal-oriented.</li><li id="c704" class="nj nk fq nl b go oi nn no gr oj nq nr ns ok nu nv nw ol ny nz oa om oc od oe of og oh bk">LLMs can’t act in the physical world — though someone could probably create a prompt to showcase this.</li></ul><p id="4879" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nj nk fq nl b go nm nn no gr np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe fj bk">While they perform impressive feats, they still lack some basic abilities that my 21-month-old daughter has. We can mimic some of those abilities with the right prompts and tooling. In generating coherent text responding to such prompts, LLMs consistently demonstrate an apparent ability to understand what we want. But to what extent do LLMs truly “understand”?</p><h1 id="b15e" class="on oo fq bf op oq or gq os ot ou gt ov ow ox oy oz pa pb pc pd pe pf pg ph pi bk">How LLMs Work</h1><figure class="ms mt mu mv mw mj mp mq paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="mz na ed nb bh nc"><div class="mp mq pj"><img src="../Images/32289cba7ec5f504ccc657e4b76e0b02.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*y9wGabTqhht7Zn8UOXToYA.png"/></div></div><figcaption class="ne nf ng mp mq nh ni bf b bg z dx">A hypothetical attention map for the incomplete sentence: “Using context to predict what’s most likely to come [MASK]”.

I won’t go into the specifics when many detailed articles have been written explaining transformers with varying levels of complexity. Instead let’s focus on the core of what an LLM does: they are statistical models that predict the likelihood of a token appearing in a piece of text given some context.</p><p id="a3b2" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nj nk fq nl b go nm nn no gr np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe fj bk">Now imagine I created a complex weather model* where patches of the Earth’s atmosphere become ‘tokens.’ Each token has attributes like humidity, temperature, and air pressure. I use the model to forecast these attributes over time-steps. If the time-steps get shorter and the patches become smaller the model is closer and closer to representing the state of the actual world. This model attempts to capture something about the likelihood of the weather we’ll see next, given the weather we’ve seen before. It may learn to very accurately predict, for example, the emergence of cyclones over time in areas where air is warm, moist, and of low pressure. But it’s not a simulation of the <em class="pk">physics</em> of Earth’s weather any more than an LLM is a simulation of brain activity.</p><p id="5ff3" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nj nk fq nl b go nm nn no gr np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe fj bk">If an LLM is a statistical model of text, what exactly is it modelling? My imagined weather prediction model tries to capture the statistics of the atmospheric conditions that generate the weather. But what is the statistical process that generates text? The process that generates text is a human brain and humans need some understanding of the world to generate that text. If a model can effectively predict text a human might write then could that prediction come with “understanding”?</p><h2 id="9529" class="pl oo fq bf op pm pn po os pp pq pr ov ns ps pt pu nw pv pw px oa py pz qa qb bk">How LLMs are trained</h2><p id="20b6" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nj nk fq nl b go qc nn no gr qd nq nr ns qe nu nv nw qf ny nz oa qg oc od oe fj bk">LLMs are trained to optimize an objective that reduces the surprise of encountering a specific token given its context. If the model encounters a token in the training data and assigns it low probability, the model’s weights are adjusted to give it a higher probability.</p><p id="a04b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nj nk fq nl b go nm nn no gr np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe fj bk">Compare that to how my daughter learns to use language. When she wants something, she uses language to communicate her desires. First, she understands what she wants on some level. Then, she must understand which words to use to get what she wants. Recently, she wanted me to fill her juice bottle but didn’t want me to take it away or walk away from her to bring more juice. Though her wants were contradictory and a bit irrational, she had several goals: (1) more juice, (2) keep the juice bottle near her, (3) daddy stays near her too. And let me tell you, she communicated this <em class="pk">very </em>effectively. Her language learning is directly tied to her understanding of how those words can get her what she wants (even if what she wants is irrational).</p><p id="9983" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nj nk fq nl b go nm nn no gr np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe fj bk">If an LLM were to exhibit understanding, it would be an emergent attribute of its statistical model of the world. The paper “Climbing Towards NLU” (Bender &amp; Koller, 2020) argues that true natural language understanding (NLU) requires grounding in the real world. Bender &amp; Koller argue that LLMs trained exclusively on statistical patterns in textual data lack real-world context or interactions to achieve actual understanding. This means that, unlike my daughter, an LLM <em class="pk">can’t</em> understand something because its communication is not grounded in the real world.</p><h1 id="8a11" class="on oo fq bf op oq or gq os ot ou gt ov ow ox oy oz pa pb pc pd pe pf pg ph pi bk">What is Understanding?</h1><p id="8cb1" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nj nk fq nl b go qc nn no gr qd nq nr ns qe nu nv nw qf ny nz oa qg oc od oe fj bk">The Wikipedia page on <a class="af qh" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">understanding</a> describes it as a cognitive process involving the use of concepts to model an object, situation, or message. It implies abilities and dispositions sufficient to support intelligent behaviour. Ludwig Wittgenstein suggested that understanding is context-dependent and is shown through intelligent behaviour rather than mere possession of knowledge.

Imagine a room filled with detailed instructions on how to respond to someone writing in Chinese. Notes written in Chinese are slid under the door, and the person inside the room can look up the symbols and follow a recipe for writing a reply. The person in the room doesn’t know Chinese but can have a convincing conversation with a person outside. Clearly, the person who constructed the room “understands” Chinese, but someone on the outside isn’t conversing with that person; they’re conversing with <em class="pk">the room</em>.

Part of the issue is that, for us, understanding comes with a subjective conscious experience of understanding.

For example:</p><blockquote class="qi qj qk"><p id="63ea" class="nj nk pk nl b go nm nn no gr np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe fj bk">Subject-verb agreement performance in language models is also dependent on the specific nouns and verbs involved (Yu et al. 2020; Chaves &amp; Richter 2021). Masked and autoregressive models produce over 40% more accurate agreement predictions for verbs that are already probable from context (Newman et al. 2021), and agreement accuracy is worse overall for infrequent verbs (Wei et al. 2021). For infrequent verbs, masked language models are biased towards the more frequent verb form seen during pretraining (e.g., singular vs. plural) (Wei et al. 2021). Error rates exceed 30% for infrequent verbs in nonce (grammatically correct but semantically meaningless) sentences (Wei et al. 2021), with further degradations if there is an intervening clause between the subject and verb as in Example 4 (Lasri, Lenci, and Poibeau 2022a).</p></blockquote><p id="3bf4" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nj nk fq nl b go nm nn no gr np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe fj bk">LLM limitations are not limited to syntactic issues (where they are arguably strongest) but also with semantics.

How do LLMs stack up in 2024? A big difference is the proliferation of benchmarks that evaluate LLMs. A March 2024 survey (Chang et al. 2024) covers performance of recent models on a wide range of benchmarks. They conclude that LLMs have strong abilities including comprehension and reasoning, but they still identify limitations. These limitations mean that LLMs have “limited abilities on abstract reasoning and are prone to confusion or errors in complex contexts”. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have also emerged which unify (at minimum) an understanding of text and images. A January 2024 survey (Wang et al.) covers a wide range of multimodal benchmarks and shows mediocre performance even for the most powerful models.</p><h2 id="6401" class="pl oo fq bf op pm pn po os pp pq pr ov ns ps pt pu nw pv pw px oa py pz qa qb bk">Anthropomorphism vs Anthropocentrism</h2><p id="f7a8" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nj nk fq nl b go qc nn no gr qd nq nr ns qe nu nv nw qf ny nz oa qg oc od oe fj bk">Anthropomorphism is a tendency of humans to think of something as having human-like attributes because it displays some behaviour similar to humans.

A key contention of the paper “Anthropocentric bias and the possibility of artificial cognition” (Millière &amp; Rathkopf) is that we use flawed tests for capabilities in artificial systems. They describe 2 types of anthropocentric bias:</p><blockquote class="qi qj qk"><p id="959f" class="nj nk pk nl b go nm nn no gr np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe fj bk">1.

Type-II anthropocentrism is the tendency to assume that even when LLMs achieve performance equal to or better than the average human, any substantive difference between the human strategy for solving the problem and the LLM strategy for solving the problem is, ipso facto, evidence that the LLM’s solution is not general. In slogan form, the assumption says: all cognitive kinds are human cognitive kinds.3 In other words, if an LLM arrives at a solution through a different computational process than humans use, Type-II anthropocentrism would lead us to conclude that the LLM’s approach is not genuinely competent, regardless of how well it performs.</p></blockquote><p id="350c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nj nk fq nl b go nm nn no gr np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe fj bk">Consider the paper “Role play with large language models” (Shanahan, McDonell, &amp; Reynolds) and the “20 questions game”:</p><blockquote class="qi qj qk"><p id="75fb" class="nj nk pk nl b go nm nn no gr np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe fj bk">In this familiar game, one player thinks of an object, and the other player has to guess what it is by asking questions with ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answers.

The agent is prompted to ‘think of an object without saying what it is’. In this situation, the dialogue agent will not randomly select an object and commit to it for the rest of the game, as a human would (or should). Rather, as the game proceeds, the dialogue agent will generate answers on the fly that are consistent with all the answers that have gone before.</p></blockquote><p id="619f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nj nk fq nl b go nm nn no gr np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe fj bk">To illuminate this point, one of my colleagues had this conversation with ChatGPT on this very question:</p><blockquote class="qi qj qk"><p id="e7c6" class="nj nk pk nl b go nm nn no gr np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe fj bk"><strong class="nl fr">User:</strong> let’s play 20 questions.

The paper has this to say: “This shortcoming is easily overcome in practice. For example, the agent could be forced to specify the object it has ‘thought of’, but in a coded form so the user does not know what it is.” This is a Type-I anthropocentrism because there is an auxiliary factor at play: for an LLM to “think” of something it must generate tokens to that effect. If it generated tokens for “thinking of an object” we could hide those from a user and show that the responses generated by the LLM are consistent. By playing the game with the LLM but not accommodating how it “thinks” we may conclude that it’s incapable of “thinking of an object” and making consistent replies to that effect.</p><h2 id="29a2" class="pl oo fq bf op pm pn po os pp pq pr ov ns ps pt pu nw pv pw px oa py pz qa qb bk">The Problem of Memorisation</h2><p id="8cb6" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nj nk fq nl b go qc nn no gr qd nq nr ns qe nu nv nw qf ny nz oa qg oc od oe fj bk">One of the key challenges for testing understanding in LLMs is that they have a strong tendency towards repeating patterns seen in their training data.

But I’ve argued this may be caused by a strong tendency to finish common text patterns in a common way. A tendency so strong it may override any understanding the model does have. In fact it’s possible to show that humans have a very similar bias. Consider this example from Kahneman’s “Thinking Fast and Slow”:</p><blockquote class="qi qj qk"><p id="e8c5" class="nj nk pk nl b go nm nn no gr np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe fj bk">A bat and a ball cost $1 and 10c.

If you (like most people) got this wrong, does this mean you don’t understand how to make simple arithmetic calculations? No, the question is designed to trick people into giving a quick answer rather than pausing to work out a solution. Kahneman describes a cognitive process in our brain (“System 1”) that responds quickly when we’ve identified a heuristic we can use to avoid thinking deeply about a problem. The cognitive process for actively thinking through a problem (“System 2”) is only activated when it seems necessary. We too have a bias for quick responses to questions with familiar patterns.</p><p id="f9bf" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nj nk fq nl b go nm nn no gr np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe fj bk">Can we design a test that delineates memorisation from understanding without manipulating known biases in these models? In my opinion, the fact that so many of these biases exist should be taken as evidence that the models exhibit a weak understanding of the content (“semantic understanding”).

And it’s even easier to trick models in “semantic understanding” through simple manipulation of the wording without changing the meaning of the content.

If not, I’d be exhibiting “Type-II anthropocentrism” — failing to ascribe an ability to an artificial system even after it demonstrates that ability. If anything ChatGPT probably “understands” more about helmets than my daughter does. After all she refuses to wear anything on her head, so she clearly doesn’t understand that in some circumstances a helmet is important.</p><p id="c0c7" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nj nk fq nl b go nm nn no gr np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe fj bk">Well, let’s probe a little further. If I said to my daughter, “I spy, with my little eye, something you wear on your head” and she pointed to a helmet, how would she respond if I asked, “Show me how?”. She would proceed to try to put the helmet on her head (then quickly throw it off!). I was curious to see what ChatGPT would make of that question and the first time it responded like this:</p><blockquote class="qi qj qk"><p id="677a" class="nj nk pk nl b go nm nn no gr np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe fj bk"><strong class="nl fr">User: </strong>Show me how</p><p id="b1b7" class="nj nk pk nl b go nm nn no gr np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe fj bk"><strong class="nl fr">Assistant:</strong> I apologize.

In computational linguistics and cognitive science, the term encapsulates various nuanced components, which range from surface-level syntactic comprehension to deep semantic cognition. While putting together this article I found the paper “Constructing a Philosophy of Science of Cognitive Science” (Bechtel 2009). Bechtel explains that we lack a set of “cognitive operations” to describe cognitive processes. Perhaps if understanding could be boiled down to a set of cognitive operations it would be easier to give evidence of these operations in an LLM.</p><figure class="ms mt mu mv mw mj mp mq paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="mz na ed nb bh nc"><div class="mp mq pj"><img src="../Images/05e3ed3b556d695944ca529eb37f87f1.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*na6YIcZ7UWMwP6kjdVZwVQ.png"/></div></div><figcaption class="ne nf ng mp mq nh ni bf b bg z dx">Hypothetical attention maps unrolled to show the a weighted graph of all words.

Perhaps finding an LLM’s cognitive operations is more tractable as it’s easier to inspect the cognitive processes of an LLM than a human brain. The attention map of tokens forms a graph of relationships between words and we could look for relationships that model the underlying concepts expressed by those words. If we find evidence that the relationships between words are truly modelling the underlying concepts, then we could find evidence of understanding. Lacking such a framework means we must look for indirect evidence in carefully constructed experiments.</p><p id="dcaa" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nj nk fq nl b go nm nn no gr np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe fj bk"><strong class="nl fr">The Role of Embodiment</strong></p><p id="38ac" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nj nk fq nl b go nm nn no gr np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe fj bk">A repeated theme in this article contrasting human understanding and LLM capabilities is embodiment. An LLM, even an advanced one like the multimodal capabilities of GPT-4, lack direct physical and sensory interaction with the world. This inability to experience phenomena first-hand might create a significant gap in its comprehension capabilities. See the paper “Intelligence Without Reason” (Brooks 1991) for a discussion of whether or not artificial intelligence needs to be embodied to understand. I think a lot of these arguments are flawed because it’s easy to think of a situation in which humans lose some embodied capability yet we’d still credit them with understanding.</p><p id="2a94" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nj nk fq nl b go nm nn no gr np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe fj bk">An interesting question on Quora “<a class="af qh" href="https://www.quora.com/Do-blind-people-understand-transparent-translucent-and-reflective-things" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Do blind people understand transparent, translucent, and reflective things?</a>” had this response:</p><blockquote class="qi qj qk"><p id="44f2" class="nj nk pk nl b go nm nn no gr np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe fj bk">In general, yes, but it’s not something we always take into consideration.

A big part of being able to think involves understanding. This is a question that’s fascinated me for some time.</p><p id="0ee8" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nj nk fq nl b go nm nn no gr np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe fj bk">Determining what LLMs understand is as much about defining understanding as it is about testing it. When the text generation of an LLM is sufficiently coherent some might argue that the coherence necessitates understanding. Is dismissing this behaviour just an anthropocentric bias? Is granting understanding making the opposite anthropomorphic bias?</p><p id="be1f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nj nk fq nl b go nm nn no gr np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe fj bk">I contend that understanding does not require embodiment or real world interaction. I argue that the most important part of understanding is an accurate internal model of the world. In the Chinese room experiment the room is filled with (what I call) “recipes” for ways to respond to different pieces of Chinese writing with other pieces of Chinese writing. The person who made those recipes had a model of how those words correspond to the world. But the room itself has no such model. We have no tools for measuring world models so we would have to assess the Chinese room’s understanding the same way we do for an LLM – and we would hit similar barriers.</p><p id="4493" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nj nk fq nl b go nm nn no gr np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe fj bk">LLMs seem to have a model of how to construct coherent sounding language. It’s possible that this model also represents the underlying concepts those words represent. A worthwhile area of research would be to investigate this through the attention graph that evolves during text generation. In the meantime, we have to investigate indirectly by testing how models respond to carefully crafted questions. These tests often involve adversarial questions which consistently demonstrate flaws in understanding. That these flaws are systematic suggests that the lack of understanding is itself systematic. However, we’ve also seen that it’s possible to design adversarial tests for humans and they don’t necessarily mean that humans lack understanding.</p><p id="2272" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nj nk fq nl b go nm nn no gr np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe fj bk">Much like we gauge the cognitive abilities of animals differently from humans, perhaps we need new conceptual tools and frameworks to assess and appreciate what LLMs do know, without falling into biases of anthropomorphism or anthropocentrism. In my view LLMs have some limited understanding but the form it takes is different to our own. Where LLMs do show signs of understanding that understanding is overshadowed by a bias towards coherent text. I suspect that given the right training objective it’s possible for our current LLM architectures to eventually learn understanding. But so long as the underlying training mechanism is “next token prediction” then any understanding is likely to be marginal and easily corrupted.</p></div></div></div><div class="ab cb ql qm qn qo" role="separator"><span class="qp by bm qq qr qs"/><span class="qp by bm qq qr qs"/><span class="qp by bm qq qr"/></div><div class="fj fk fl fm fn"><div class="ab cb"><div class="ci bh ev ew ex ey"><h2 id="4db5" class="pl oo fq bf op pm pn po os pp pq pr ov ns ps pt pu nw pv pw px oa py pz qa qb bk">Who Am I?</h2><p id="8cd1" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nj nk fq nl b go qc nn no gr qd nq nr ns qe nu nv nw qf ny nz oa qg oc od oe fj bk">I build <a class="af qh" href="https://www.affinda.com/platform" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">AI to automate document processing</a> @ <a class="af qh" href="https://www.affinda.com/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Affinda</a>.
