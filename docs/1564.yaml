- en: One year ago today, on May 13th 2023, I was laid off. Today, I started the first
    day at my new job. Over the past year, I became a mother and discovered parts
    of myself I never knew existed.

    for tips on cracking coding interviews or nailing behavioral questions, this isn’t
    that kind of post.** Those often detail how many big tech companies the authors
    interviewed with, the offers they received, the prep resources they used, and
    even provide a funnel of their interview pipeline. They always conclude with,
    “It wasn’t easy. I cried and worried, but here I am. Good luck!” While I respect
    and appreciate their candor, they often leave me feeling anxious and inadequate.

    you’re at. I want to reach out to those who feel cold and frustrated on their
    journey, as I once did. Here’s one of my personal philosophies: success stories
    don’t motivate me unless they detail the hardships and how they were overcome.
    I want to learn from mistakes and obstacles, not from someone else’s cheerful
    party.'
