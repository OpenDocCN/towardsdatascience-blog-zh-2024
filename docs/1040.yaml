- en: Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are a standard approach to studying cause-effect
    relationships and identifying the impact or effectiveness of new treatments, interventions,
    and policies. Still, the reliability and applicability of their outcomes may be
    significantly influenced by spatial factors (i.e., features related to geographical
    contexts in which the studies are implemented). Understanding and tackling these
    spatial issues, mainly where treatments are applied in real-world settings, is
    critical to preventing and mitigating potential distortions and biases from RCT
    results. But what exactly are these spatial factors, and how can they skew the
    results of an RCT? More importantly, how can researchers effectively manage these
    spatially induced variations to maintain the integrity of their studies?

- en: When I refer to spatial factors in the context of RCTs, I mean that geographical
    elements often play a role in those studies, and not accounting for them can lead
    to severe misinterpretations. These factors can include the location's climate,
    population density, cultural practices, health infrastructure, and even socioeconomic
    conditions.
