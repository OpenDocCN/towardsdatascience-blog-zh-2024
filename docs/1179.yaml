    who use increasingly complex algorithms to feed in larger and larger datasets
    seem more mystical than ever in terms of their prediction process.

    forecasts, I couldn’t help but wonder: Are data scientists just modern-day fortune
    tellers with mysterious but powerful magic that bless businesses with wise decisions?'

    the future based on my experience and reflections as a data scientist who consistently
    strives to gain trust in my predictions, even from myself.

    the science behind it would distinguish me from the ‘black-box’ magic used in
    fortune-telling. My model makes sense because we have ample features, trustworthy
    algorithms, and decent historical performance.

    gap between business decision-makers and model builders. Models built with the
    most cutting-edge buzzwords and unfathomable amounts of data always bring mixed
    feelings to stakeholders.
