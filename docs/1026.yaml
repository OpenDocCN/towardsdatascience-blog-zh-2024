    approach to statistics and frequentist inference provides objectivity.

- en: While Bayesian statistics can certainly be used to incorporate subjective knowledge,
    it also provides powerful methods to do objective analysis. Moreover, objective
    Bayesian inference probably has a stronger argument for objectivity than many
    frequentist methods such as P-values [21].

- en: This blog post provides a brief introduction to objective Bayesian inference.
    It discusses the history of objective Bayesian inference from inverse probability
    up to modern reference priors, how metrics such as frequentist matching coverage
    provide a way to quantify what it means for a prior to be objective, and how to
    build objective priors. Finally, it revisits a few classical problems studied
    by Bayes and Laplace to show how they might be solved with a more modern approach
    to objective Bayesian inference.
