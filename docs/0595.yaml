- en: It is not the first time that researchers try to apply natural language processing
    (NLP) techniques to the field of time series.

- en: For example, the Transformer architecture was a significant milestone in NLP,
    but its performance in time series forecasting remained average, until [PatchTST](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/patchtst-a-breakthrough-in-time-series-forecasting-e02d48869ccc)
    was proposed.

    demonstrated impressive generalization and reasoning capabilities in NLP.

- en: Thus, it is worth exploring the idea of repurposing an LLM for time series forecasting,
    such that we can benefit from the capabilities of those large pre-trained models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To that end, [Time-LLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01728.pdf) was proposed.
    In the original paper, the researchers propose a framework to reprogram an existing
    LLM to perform time series forecasting.

- en: In this article, we explore the architecture of Time-LLM and how it can effectively
    allow an LLM to predict time series data. Then, we implement the model and apply
    it in a small forecasting project.
