    it a little bit (like good mathematicians do) we can say that the joke is about
    the fact that **the information of a particle of a group** can be used to inform
    all the other particles. This concept is actually way deeper than the joke I just
    said and can be exploited further.

    We can define this system as one made of **particles** (e.g. a particle is a bird).
    We can also assume with a good degree of approximation that these particles move
    around in space adjusting their positions based on two factors:'
