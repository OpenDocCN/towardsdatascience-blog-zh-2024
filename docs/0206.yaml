    remove noise. This story shows how to implement a low-pass filter in SQL / BigQuery
    that can come in handy when improving ML features.

- en: Filtering of time-series data is one of the most useful preprocessing tools
    in Data Science. In reality, data is almost always a combination of signal and
    noise where the noise is not only defined by the lack of periodicity but also
    by not representing the information of interest. For example, imagine daily visitation
    to a retail store. If you are interested in how seasonal changes impact visitation,
    you might not be interested in short-term patterns due to weekday changes (there
    might be an overall higher visitation on Saturdays compared to Mondays, but that
    is not what you are interested in).

- en: Even though this might look like a small issue in the data, noise or irrelevant
    information (like the short-term visitation pattern) certainly increases your
    feature complexity and, thus, impacts your model. If not removing that noise,
    your model complexity and volume of training data should be adjusted accordingly
    to avoid overfitting.
