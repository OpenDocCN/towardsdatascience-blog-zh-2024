    engineer to a machine learning engineer (MLE) at FAANG companies. Having successfully
    transitioned myself, I can say that the biggest challenge I faced was not knowing
    where to start and feeling lost without a clear plan.

    role requires the individual to **already be performing** at the level expected
    for that role. Identify the criteria that will be used for evaluation during your
    transition to an MLE role. Generally, Software Engineers and MLEs are evaluated
    differently during performance feedback sessions.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Software Engineer, often the emphasis is more on scalable system design,
    code quality and project complexity. With MLE, generally the emphasis is much
    more on **Impact to the business metric** and **technical expertise**. This is
    because, ML has a longer cycle of development compared to software engineering
    and are often directly tied to specific business metrics.
