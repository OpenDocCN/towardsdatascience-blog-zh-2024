    tooling for business operations. These include dashboards, custom UIs for niche
    systems, toolings that make complex algorithms accessible, etc. Assessing the
    quality of such tooling is important. In HCI courses and mainstream HCI research,
    **controlled user studies** are the most popular way of evaluating a tool’s effectiveness.

    supports and the user population for which it is supposed to target. Different
    conditions of the tool are also designed to have some form of a baseline for comparing
    the tool. The tool is measured against how well the user accomplishes the task
    on the tool. Different metrics, such as the duration for a user to complete the
    task, are measured and used to compare different conditions of the tool.

    the practicalities of HCI in an industry, enterprise setting. In this short blog,
    I will outline some insights I have had working in the industry as an HCI researcher
    in a diverse team of NLP and Database researchers dedicated to conversational
    and language AI systems and their evaluations.
