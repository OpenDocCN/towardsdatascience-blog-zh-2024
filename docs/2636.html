attendance has been a frequent occurrence for me as a data professional since my early career days. The field of data science is so vast and diverse. While that means that there is a huge variety of data roles and practitioners out there, it could also mean that no matter how small your niche, or how specific and esoteric your specific problem is, there is always someone else out there with the same problem in a different company. The proof is in the endless number of questions and memes in Stack Overflow /Kaggle threads and other knowledge-base forums. During my early career connecting with the data community out there was so helpful for me to learn novel techniques and apply new knowledge to some of the old problems I was solving and become a more efficient analyst.</p><blockquote class="nx ny nz"><p id="c653" class="nb nc oa nd b go ne nf ng gr nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw fj bk"><strong class="nd fr">“Many ideas grow better when transplanted into another mind than the one where they sprang up.” — Oliver Wendell Holmes.</strong></p></blockquote><p id="f8b7" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nb nc fq nd b go ne nf ng gr nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw fj bk">More recently, I started attending data community gatherings and conferences as a speaker and having a seat at the table with expert panels and the speaker lounges has been a game changer. It has helped me immensely to think creatively about my job and role in Data Stewardship and become a better data mentor and steward for folks who rely on my expertise. I recently attended Data Connect 2024 as a speaker. While most of the conferences happening in the past couple of years have been heavily focused on AI, I was fortunate enough to learn about the following three critical aspects of Data Analytics and management that I could easily apply in my day-to-day responsibilities. In this article, I’ll be sharing my interpretation and learnings from these sessions, action items, and my reflections on these crucial data topics as a data practitioner of over 12 years.</p><h2 id="939d" class="ob oc fq bf od oe of og oh oi oj ok ol nk om on oo no op oq or ns os ot ou ov bk"><strong class="al">1. Cost containment</strong></h2><p id="8879" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nb nc fq nd b go ow nf ng gr ox ni nj nk oy nm nn no oz nq nr ns pa nu nv nw fj bk">The concept of Data ROI gets talked about a lot, but rarely does it get quantified and becomes an official metric that gets tracked and shared out consistently. Cost containment has been on my mind for me both as an Individual Contributor and a Team Lead, starting from my days as an Analytics Intern. Who can forget their first time letting their un-optimized SQL query with full outer joins run for several hours before getting a warning call from their org’s DBA? (Not me !) Ever since then, Cost containment has been one of those concepts that has been living rent-free in my brain. Many data solutions providers have switched from a Tier-based pricing model to a consumption-based pricing model which makes cost optimization an essential tool in the data management and leadership toolkit.</p><p id="b9a0" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nb nc fq nd b go ne nf ng gr nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw fj bk">Data teams may face unexpected bills when query optimization is overlooked or when inefficient data practices are in place. For instance, apart from running extensive queries, even failing to archive unused data can lead to substantial increases in data storage costs. To manage such unexpected expenses, it is crucial to implement effective cost management strategies. This includes monitoring usage patterns, optimizing queries, and setting up alerts for unusual activity. By understanding these hidden costs, teams can better control their data tools’ pricing, ensuring a sustainable data ROI. I also learned about the importance of investing in training data teams to optimize their use of analytics tools. Educating staff on cost-efficient query writing and data handling ensures that resources are utilized to their full potential is often overlooked, but it is one of the low-hanging fruits that can be effective in cutting costs.</p><p id="c8e0" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nb nc fq nd b go ne nf ng gr nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw fj bk">Another pitfall occurs when data teams fail to accurately forecast their data usage. This oversight can result in substantial unanticipated expenses, particularly when scaling operations rapidly. To avoid these pitfalls, it is essential for organizations to maintain open communication with vendors, closely monitor data usage, and regularly review contract terms. By anticipating changes and preparing for potential cost fluctuations, businesses can better manage their data tools pricing and ensure their data ROI remains positive.</p><p id="d29f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nb nc fq nd b go ne nf ng gr nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw fj bk"><strong class="nd fr">Actionable takeaways:</strong></p><ul class=""><li id="cb88" class="nb nc fq nd b go ne nf ng gr nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw pb pc pd bk"><strong class="nd fr">Managing Expenses:</strong> To effectively monitor expenses, data teams should implement comprehensive dashboards that provide real-time insights into spending patterns. These tools should highlight daily, weekly, and monthly cost trends, enabling teams to spot irregularities swiftly. Additionally, setting up automated alerts for unusual usage or spending spikes can further safeguard against budget overruns.</li><li id="2dbb" class="nb nc fq nd b go pe nf ng gr pf ni nj nk pg nm nn no ph nq nr ns pi nu nv nw pb pc pd bk"><strong class="nd fr">Anticipating Fluctuations</strong>: Maintain open communication with vendors, closely monitor data usage, and regularly review contract terms.

As I was wrapping up my notes from listening to a talk related to Data Analytics Team efficiencies, one of the moderators sparked up an interesting discussion related to “Data Translation” and the need for dedicated organizational efforts to bridge the literacy gaps between Data and Business teams.</p><figure class="ml mm mn mo mp mq mi mj paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="mr ms ed mt bh mu"><div class="mi mj mk"><img src="../Images/774f2a9046ace45b8d0aa409ecc2142a.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*Zln0zGEsIfA9PS26CRM2UQ.png"/></div></div><figcaption class="mw mx my mi mj mz na bf b bg z dx">Bridging the Data and Business Literacy Gaps: Image generated by Author using AI prompts in Microsoft Co-pilot</figcaption></figure><p id="45f3" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nb nc fq nd b go ne nf ng gr nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw fj bk">As data infrastructure and data team hiring costs have been consistently increasing, it’s crucial for businesses to see a return on this investment. High costs can be justified only if the data team’s work translates into actionable insights that drive business growth, innovation, and efficiency. Without clear value, these expenses can seem burdensome. Data leaders need to ensure that their teams are aligned with business objectives and are working on projects that offer substantial returns.

The process of brainstorming and picking a well-rounded topic, being okay with imperfections, and finally getting it all mapped into an overall governing idea made me reflect on how Data storytelling is much more than pretty charts and documenting patterns. I also got to listen to a great presentation focusing on Effective visual communication tips for data presentations. I learned that by integrating narrative with data visualization, you engage both the logical and emotional sides of your audience’s brain, making your insights more memorable. This approach ensures that data isn’t just seen as numbers on a page but as a critical driver of strategic decisions. I also learned that aligning your data story with the audience’s needs and data literacy is the easiest way to encourage them to take meaningful action based on the data.</p><p id="ca73" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nb nc fq nd b go ne nf ng gr nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw fj bk"><strong class="nd fr">Actionable takeaways :</strong></p><ul class=""><li id="0fef" class="nb nc fq nd b go ne nf ng gr nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw pb pc pd bk"><strong class="nd fr">Clearly define the purpose of the Data story: </strong>Let the audience know upfront about the learning objectives and identify the main takeaway. This core message acts as the foundation of your narrative, guiding every decision you make in terms of data visualization and storytelling techniques.</li><li id="f071" class="nb nc fq nd b go pe nf ng gr pf ni nj nk pg nm nn no ph nq nr ns pi nu nv nw pb pc pd bk"><strong class="nd fr">The governing idea: </strong>Find the core message you’re delivering by performing data analysis and fit your data story into a compelling arc. The outline I used for my talk was to identify the problem, make the problem relatable to the audience, solutions and supporting facts and charts for why the solution works, and finally an inspiring end followed by a call to action.</li><li id="608e" class="nb nc fq nd b go pe nf ng gr pf ni nj nk pg nm nn no ph nq nr ns pi nu nv nw pb pc pd bk"><strong class="nd fr">Supporting Elements</strong> Use Visualizations, metrics, and Annotations to support your data story. Every data point used to support your story arc strengthens the core message and plays a significant role in reinforcing your message. It is also important to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the data metrics you use. These should align with your core message and provide insight into the story you’re telling. Use color strategically to highlight key data points and maintain audience focus. Consistency and contrast are key elements in effective color usage.</li></ul><h2 id="8a46" class="ob oc fq bf od oe of og oh oi oj ok ol nk om on oo no op oq or ns os ot ou ov bk"><strong class="al">Conclusion</strong></h2><p id="4f5d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nb nc fq nd b go ow nf ng gr ox ni nj nk oy nm nn no oz nq nr ns pa nu nv nw fj bk">Attending data conferences is a great way to keep up with the current trends and learn new concepts.
