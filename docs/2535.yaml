    powerful, won’t give any company a lasting competitive edge. After all, over the
    past two years, large-scale LLMs have become a commodity for everyone. I’ve been
    thinking a lot about how companies can shape a competitive advantage using AI,
    and a recent article in the Harvard Business Review ([AI Won’t Give You a New
    Sustainable Advantage](https://hbr.org/2024/09/ai-wont-give-you-a-new-sustainable-advantage))

    hand of AI, the equal-opportunity hypothesis might ring true. But until then,
    there are so many ways — big and small — for companies to differentiate themselves
    using AI. I like to think of it as a complex ingredient in your business recipe
    — the success of the final dish depends on the cook who is making it. The magic

    It’s about finding AI’s unique sweet spot in your organization, making critical
    design decisions, and aligning a variety of stakeholders around the optimal design,
    deployment, and usage of your AI systems. In the following, I will illustrate
    this using the mental model we developed to structure our thinking about AI projects

    experiment and travel to the 16th century. Antonio and Bartolomeo are the best
    shoemakers in Florence (which means they’re probably the best in the world). Antonio’s
    family has meticulously recorded their craft for generations, with shelves of
    notes on leather treatments, perfect fits, and small adjustments learned from
    years of experience. On the other hand, Bartolomeo’s family has kept their secrets
    more closely guarded. They don’t write anything down; their shoemaking expertise
    has been passed down verbally, from father to son.

    technology that can automate their whole shoemaking business — if it can learn
    from their data. Antonio comes with his wagon of detailed documentation, and the
    technology can directly learn from those centuries of know-how. Bartolomeo is
    in trouble — without written records, there’s nothing explicit for the AI to chew
    on. His family’s expertise is trapped in oral tradition, intuition, and muscle
    memory. Should he try to write all of it down now — is it even possible, given
    that most of his work is governed intuitively? Or should he just let it be and
    go on with his manual business-as-usual? Succumbing to inertia and uncertainty,
    he goes for the latter option, while Antonio’s business strives and grows with
    the help of the new technology. Freed from daily routine tasks, he can get creative
    and invent new ways to make and improve shoes.

    information passively; they *curate* and edit it, refining and selecting data
    that reflects a deep understanding of their specific industry. This careful approach

    ensuring data is continuously adapted and doesn’t drift apart from reality. The
    most successful companies understand this and regularly update their datasets
    to reflect changing environments and market dynamics. A power mechanism to achieve
    this is the **data flywheel**. The more your AI generates insights, the better
    your data becomes, creating a self-reinforcing feedback loop because users will
    come back to your system more often. With every cycle, your data sharpens and
    your AI improves, building an advantage that competitors will struggle to match.
    To kick off the data flywheel, your system needs to demonstrate some initial value
    to start with — and then, you can bake in some additional incentives to nudge
    your users into using your system on a regular basis.

    the use of massive LLMs such as the GPT models. Good for them — bad for those
    of us who want to use AI in real-life applications. Overrelying on these heavyweights

    performance across a wide range of tasks. However, in business, decent isn’t enough.
    You need to send your AI model to university so it can specialize, respond to
    your specific business needs, and excel in your domain. This is where fine-tuning
    comes into play. However, it’s important to recognize that mainstream LLMs, while
    powerful, can quickly become slow and expensive if not managed efficiently. As
    Big Tech boasts about larger model sizes and longer context windows — i.e., how
    much information you can feed into one prompt — smart tech is quietly moving towards
    efficiency. Techniques like prompt compression reduce prompt size, making interactions
    faster and more cost-effective. **Small language models (SLMs)** are another trend
    (Figure 4). With up to a couple of billions of parameters, they allow companies
    to safely deploy task- and domain-specific intelligence on their internal infrastructure
    ([Anacode](http://anacode.de/tpost/sz7xgnigh1-bigger-is-not-always-better-unlocking-ef)).

    right solution for your specific challenge. In many cases, predictive AI models
    — those that focus on forecasting outcomes rather than generating content — are
    more effective, cheaper, and easier to defend from a competitive standpoint. And
    while this might sound like old news, most of AI value creation in businesses

    Compound systems can accommodate different models, databases, and software tools

    engineering, optimization, and the integration of multiple models, the costs can
    be reduced by as much as 98% ([FrugalGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05176)).
    Yes, you read it right, that’s **2% of the original cost** — a staggering difference,
