involved in the hiring process for data scientists a dozen times or more over my career, while never being the hiring manager myself, and I have been closely involved in writing the job description for several of these. It kind of seems like this should be easy — you’re just trying to convince people to apply for your job, so you can pick the one you like best, right?</p><p id="4fa1" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Well, it’s actually more complicated than that. Most of the people out there in the world are not qualified for any given job, and even among those who are qualified, there may be reasons they wouldn’t like working in this role. It’s not a one-way street; you don’t want just anybody to apply, you want the best suited people, for whom this job would work, to apply. So, how do you thread that needle? What should you write?</p><blockquote class="nz oa ob"><p id="9515" class="nd ne oc nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">This column is only my opinion and does not represent the views of my employer.

These two can be quite different situations, with different needs and challenges in certain areas.</p><blockquote class="nz oa ob"><p id="d0a4" class="nd ne oc nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">You may notice I’m using “DS/ML” a lot in this article — I consider the advice here good for people hiring data scientists as well as those hiring machine learning engineers, so I want to be inclusive where possible.

Think about how this person will fit into your organization, and be clear about that as you proceed.</p><h2 id="1890" class="pm oe fq bf of pn po pp oi pq pr ps ol nm pt pu pv nq pw px py nu pz qa qb qc bk"><strong class="al">The Small Organization</strong></h2><p id="1296" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go oz nh ni gr pa nk nl nm pb no np nq pc ns nt nu pd nw nx ny fj bk">A challenge, especially for small organizations with limited or no existing DS/ML capability or expertise, is that you don’t really know what your ML Engineer or Data Scientist may end up doing. You know what general outcomes you’d like this person to produce, but you don’t know how they’ll achieve them, because this isn’t your area of expertise!</p><p id="7335" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">However, you’ll still need to figure out some way to describe the role’s responsibilities anyway. I advise being honest and up-front about the level of data science sophistication at your company, and explaining the outcomes you’re hoping to see. Candidates with enough experience and skill to help you will be able to conceptualize how they’d attack the problem, and in the interview process you should ask them to do that. You should have some kind of project or goal in mind for this person, otherwise why are you hiring in the first place?</p><h2 id="ab44" class="pm oe fq bf of pn po pp oi pq pr ps ol nm pt pu pv nq pw px py nu pz qa qb qc bk"><strong class="al">The Larger Organization</strong></h2><p id="643c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go oz nh ni gr pa nk nl nm pb no np nq pc ns nt nu pd nw nx ny fj bk">In this case, you already have at least a couple of DS/ML staff members, so you can hopefully call on those folks to tell you what the job is like day to day for an IC. Ask them! It’s surprising how often you’ll find HR or management not actually taking advantage of the expertise they already have in house in situations like this.</p><p id="d1a1" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">However, you should also determine whether this new hire is going to be doing mostly or entirely the same thing as someone already in place, or whether they may end up filling a different kind of gap. If your existing problem is just having not enough skilled hands to do all the work on your plate, then it’s probably reasonable to expect the new hire will be filling a role similar to what’s there. But, if you are hiring someone for a very specific skillset (say, a new NLP problem came up and nobody on your team knows that stuff very well), then make sure you are clear in your job posting about the unique responsibilities this role will have to pioneer.</p><h1 id="2d91" class="od oe fq bf of og oh gq oi oj ok gt ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou ov ow ox oy bk">What do you need?</h1><p id="6a42" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go oz nh ni gr pa nk nl nm pb no np nq pc ns nt nu pd nw nx ny fj bk">This brings us to an important point, as well — how much experience and which skills does your candidate need to have in order to successfully do the job?</p><h2 id="94db" class="pm oe fq bf of pn po pp oi pq pr ps ol nm pt pu pv nq pw px py nu pz qa qb qc bk"><strong class="al">The Small Organization</strong></h2><ul class=""><li id="557e" class="nd ne fq nf b go oz nh ni gr pa nk nl nm pb no np nq pc ns nt nu pd nw nx ny pe pf pg bk">Experience: If this person is your first or second DS/ML hire, <strong class="nf fr">do not</strong> <strong class="nf fr">hire someone without some substantial work experience</strong>. These folks will cost more, but in your situation, you need someone who can be very self-directed and who has seen data science and machine learning practice done well in other professional settings already. This might go without saying, but you have little or no in-house capacity to train this person on the job, so you need them to already have acquired training from other previous roles.</li><li id="5e89" class="nd ne fq nf b go ph nh ni gr pi nk nl nm pj no np nq pk ns nt nu pl nw nx ny pe pf pg bk">Technical skills: But what skills do you really need to look for, then? What technical competencies, programming languages, etc will someone need to have to pursue your goals effectively? Beyond making sure that they can use Python, I’d recommend seeking advice from other practitioners in the field already if you can, to ask them what the skillset for your needs should look like. This changes a lot, as this is a very fast-moving discipline, so I can’t tell you today what your Data Scientist or MLE will need to be able to do a year from now. (<a class="af nc" href="https://medium.com/towards-data-science/your-data-scientist-does-not-need-a-stem-ph-d-7f2206f43871" rel="noopener">I can tell you that asking for a Ph.D. is almost definitely not the answer.</a>)</li></ul><p id="b804" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">If you do go looking for advice, make sure you’re consulting people who are practicing DS/ML on the ground, not just “thought leaders” or people who market themselves as recruiting whisperers. If you don’t know anybody directly who fits the bill, try looking through your network or reaching out to DS/ML professional organizations. Take a look at other job postings that sound like what you need, but be cautious, since these other postings may not be that good either.</p><p id="fa76" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Regardless, take this seriously — if you write unrealistic, unreasonable, or absurdly irrelevant/outdated skills in your job description, you will turn off qualified candidates because they’ll recognize “Oh, this company doesn’t know what they’re doing”, and that will defeat the whole point of this exercise.</p><p id="a641" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Another option is finding a freelancer in data science/machine learning to get you started, instead of hiring someone yourself at all. There are a lot of fractional or freelance practitioners these days, as well as consulting firms that can take this whole problem off your plate. A quick google of “fractional data scientist” produces lots of options, but remember to do your due diligence.</p><h2 id="52c4" class="pm oe fq bf of pn po pp oi pq pr ps ol nm pt pu pv nq pw px py nu pz qa qb qc bk"><strong class="al">The Larger Organization</strong></h2><ul class=""><li id="b070" class="nd ne fq nf b go oz nh ni gr pa nk nl nm pb no np nq pc ns nt nu pd nw nx ny pe pf pg bk">Experience: I’m a big believer in hiring less senior folks and training them up, if your organization can handle it. New entrants to the field have to learn somehow, and business experience is often the biggest gap in a new data scientist’s skillset. Consider whether you really need to hire a Senior Staff Machine Learning Engineer, or whether you could promote internally and backfill a junior person. There’s no right or wrong answer, but give it some thought instead of jumping right to hiring the most senior level. We senior folks are both expensive and rare!</li><li id="4e6b" class="nd ne fq nf b go ph nh ni gr pi nk nl nm pj no np nq pk ns nt nu pl nw nx ny pe pf pg bk">Technical skills: As with the job responsibilities, this is time to ask your existing team for their advice. Don’t just ask them what tech they use, also ask them what they might like to learn, if there was someone skilled brought on who could share that knowledge. (These skills go in Optional or Nice to Have, not Requirements!) You already have a DS/ML tech stack in place, of course, so the new person will need to be able to work with that, but if there are adjacent or newer technologies that might benefit your team, this is a good time to find out and potentially bring them on board. Don’t fall into the trap of asking for only the same stuff everyone in your org already uses, without giving any consideration or value to additional other competencies.</li></ul><p id="9726" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Also keep in mind what your candidates need to already have, in contrast with what they could learn on the job from your team. Don’t inflate your requirements to make the role sound more prestigious, or to artificially weed out candidates, especially if you’re not paying commensurate with those inflated requirements, because you’ll be shooting yourself in the foot. You’ll be deterring the candidates who might be a good fit for the level, and getting overqualified people in the pipeline who wouldn’t accept the pay you have available. <a class="af nc" href="https://medium.com/towards-data-science/your-data-scientist-does-not-need-a-stem-ph-d-7f2206f43871" rel="noopener">And don’t ask for a Ph.D. if it’s not vital!

But my shorthand advice, at least today, is:</p><ul class=""><li id="2976" class="nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny pe pf pg bk"><strong class="nf fr">Data Scientist</strong>: Not responsible for data engineering, pipelining, or doing their own deployment, although they may be capable of it. May do BI or analytics as well as model development.</li><li id="061e" class="nd ne fq nf b go ph nh ni gr pi nk nl nm pj no np nq pk ns nt nu pl nw nx ny pe pf pg bk"><strong class="nf fr">Machine Learning Engineer</strong>: Responsible for any or all of data engineering, pipelining, and doing their own deployment.

No work experience. Maybe an internship.</li><li id="9555" class="nd ne fq nf b go ph nh ni gr pi nk nl nm pj no np nq pk ns nt nu pl nw nx ny pe pf pg bk"><strong class="nf fr">No Level</strong>: May have had one or two professional jobs or 2–3 years experience.</li><li id="5ffa" class="nd ne fq nf b go ph nh ni gr pi nk nl nm pj no np nq pk ns nt nu pl nw nx ny pe pf pg bk"><strong class="nf fr">Senior</strong>: 3+ years professional experience.</li></ul><p id="b8a5" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Beyond that, there are higher levels that some orgs have and some don’t:</p><ul class=""><li id="3b04" class="nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny pe pf pg bk"><strong class="nf fr">Staff</strong>: maybe 6–10 years professional experience.</li><li id="59e8" class="nd ne fq nf b go ph nh ni gr pi nk nl nm pj no np nq pk ns nt nu pl nw nx ny pe pf pg bk"><strong class="nf fr">Principal, Senior Staff, etc</strong>: More than that.

If you are looking for someone fresh out of school to do some modeling and analytics, but engineers can handle the deployment etc, you need an Associate Data Scientist.</p><p id="bb1d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">This advice is subject to change as the field continues to evolve. If you really want to write something special like Machine Learning Scientist, I’d advise against it unless you have a really good explanation as to why. Clarity and findability are key here — use the terms your candidates will be familiar with and searching for.</p><h1 id="af39" class="od oe fq bf of og oh gq oi oj ok gt ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou ov ow ox oy bk">Selling Yourselves</h1><p id="475f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go oz nh ni gr pa nk nl nm pb no np nq pc ns nt nu pd nw nx ny fj bk">Now we can move on to your pitch: sell your organization as a good place to work, and share the compensation/benefits that you have to offer. We’ve spent a lot of time telling the candidates what they need to bring, and what they need to be prepared to do if they get this job, but that’s not all that a job description is about. You actually also need to be advertising your company and department as an appealing place to work, in order to get the best candidates on your radar. This advice is mostly generalizable to any organization size.</p><h2 id="6877" class="pm oe fq bf of pn po pp oi pq pr ps ol nm pt pu pv nq pw px py nu pz qa qb qc bk">Don’t Lie</h2><p id="59c0" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go oz nh ni gr pa nk nl nm pb no np nq pc ns nt nu pd nw nx ny fj bk">I have a few rules of thumb when it comes to describing a company to job candidates, in writing or in interviews. The main one is Don’t Lie. Don’t say you have a “fast paced culture” when it takes three weeks to deploy. Don’t say you “value work life balance” when no one on this team has taken a vacation in a year. And DON’T say “remote” when you mean “hybrid” for pete’s sake! You may think you’re just throwing in nice-sounding boilerplate, but these words mean something.</p><p id="68c4" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Feeling like you got bait-and-switched into joining an organization that is a bad fit is awful. Think of it like selling a product — if you overpromise and underdeliver, maybe you made that initial sale, but that customer is going to churn and be out the door with a bad taste in their mouth as soon as they realize their mistake. Then you not only do not have that customer, you have someone out there in the world with a bad opinion of your company who may be telling their whole network about this experience.</p><blockquote class="nz oa ob"><p id="6dcf" class="nd ne oc nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">If you can’t think of good selling points for your company that aren’t either lies or stretching the truth, then you need to take a cold hard look at your company’s operations.</p></blockquote><p id="c0fc" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Being honest will not only make your eventual hire better, but it will attract candidates who really do want to work in a company like yours. Everyone has different wants and needs from a job, and not everyone wants to work at a place that “works hard and plays hard”. There’s not one right culture for companies, and owning the culture your company has will get you the candidates who could be happy working there.</p><h2 id="58bd" class="pm oe fq bf of pn po pp oi pq pr ps ol nm pt pu pv nq pw px py nu pz qa qb qc bk">Value Diversity</h2><p id="4f4b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go oz nh ni gr pa nk nl nm pb no np nq pc ns nt nu pd nw nx ny fj bk">One other important key is ensuring and displaying that your company values and includes all the angles of diversity among your staff. Your job description is the candidate’s first introduction to how you’re taking care of your people, regardless of protected class or general diversity of experience, background, ability, etc. In this case, that means you need to consider your choices of language very carefully. Unless you really mean it, don’t ask for an “expert” in a skill set. Don’t say your candidates must be “rock stars”. This is both deterring to candidates with reasonable humility about their skills, and also makes your organization sound, well, kind of like jerks.</p><blockquote class="nz oa ob"><p id="120e" class="nd ne oc nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Note: the old saw that we’ve all heard a million times that “women don’t apply to a job unless they meet all the requirements” is very, very tired, and problematic for many reasons, but it does remind us to ask for skills you actually need, not just a laundry list of wishes.</p></blockquote><p id="0d7d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Instead, <a class="af nc" href="https://www.inclusionhub.com/articles/inclusive-job-descriptions" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">use inclusive language</a>. I advise writing your desired qualifications in the form of “Successful candidates can do ….” and then write action oriented items like “build machine learning models using Python” or “perform model evaluation using appropriate metrics such as recall, precision, MAE, RMSE, etc”. Be clear, and make it easy for someone to say “oh, I can do that” or “nope, I can’t do that”.</p><p id="f011" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">If you know your pool of potential candidates is very homogeneous, for example because not many people of color get college degrees in your field, consider whether you need to take extra steps to get your job in front of those candidates. Take the time to post jobs on diversity-oriented job boards, and share your posting with professional organizations for different kinds of people. If your posting never gets seen by varied individuals, you won’t get varied candidates applying.</p><h2 id="97c2" class="pm oe fq bf of pn po pp oi pq pr ps ol nm pt pu pv nq pw px py nu pz qa qb qc bk">Compensation and Benefits</h2><p id="33aa" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go oz nh ni gr pa nk nl nm pb no np nq pc ns nt nu pd nw nx ny fj bk">Now this should really go without saying, but be transparent and clear about the benefits and compensation for the role. Give a compensation range <strong class="nf fr">even if you don’t have to by law</strong>. If you’re not hiring in a state that requires a compensation range, you may think that isn’t an issue for you, but it actually is, because candidates with choices will prefer to apply to postings where they can clearly see the pay is commensurate with their expectations. It makes you look exploitative to leave off a compensation range (or to give a range spanning $100k so the range is effectively useless). Get with the times and give a reasonable range.</p><p id="e52c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Also, I already mentioned it but it bears repeating — be honest about the working circumstances. Don’t advertise a job as “remote” only to reveal in the interviews that it’s 3 days a week on site. That’s also really bad practice and a rude waste of everyone’s time. Give candidates the details they need to make an informed decision about applying.</p><p id="62ce" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Beyond that, remember that health insurance is important to anyone in America looking for a job, and be as clear as you can be about what you are offering. If you can list the insurance carrier, do that; it may help people know if their doctor or provider would be in network. It’s not a huge deal to every candidate, but many candidates, including those with disabilities or health concerns (or dependents with concerns) will appreciate it.</p><h1 id="8518" class="od oe fq bf of og oh gq oi oj ok gt ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou ov ow ox oy bk">Conclusion</h1><p id="c4a8" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go oz nh ni gr pa nk nl nm pb no np nq pc ns nt nu pd nw nx ny fj bk">Hiring for technical roles, including DS/ML, is hard. This advice might all sound like a lot of work you’d rather avoid, but consider: the alternative is weeding through thousands of applications from terribly unqualified candidates, or candidates who would never accept the job. Do some work up front so you’re not wasting your own time and that of the applicants down the road. It’s not only more efficient, it’s also the ethical choice. Applicants are real people and deserve to be treated as such.</p><p id="b233" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">To recap:</p><ul class=""><li id="44de" class="nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny pe pf pg bk">Figure out what the job would do (or what outcomes you want to see)</li><li id="0eab" class="nd ne fq nf b go ph nh ni gr pi nk nl nm pj no np nq pk ns nt nu pl nw nx ny pe pf pg bk">Figure out what the experience level and technical skillset needs to be (not your dream wish list, but realistic needs)</li><li id="0644" class="nd ne fq nf b go ph nh ni gr pi nk nl nm pj no np nq pk ns nt nu pl nw nx ny pe pf pg bk">Write a job title that’s clear, accurate, and searchable</li><li id="a824" class="nd ne fq nf b go ph nh ni gr pi nk nl nm pj no np nq pk ns nt nu pl nw nx ny pe pf pg bk">Don’t lie about your organization or the job</li><li id="d217" class="nd ne fq nf b go ph nh ni gr pi nk nl nm pj no np nq pk ns nt nu pl nw nx ny pe pf pg bk">State the compensation range up front, and describe the benefits</li></ul><p id="61ba" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Good luck out there!</p></div></div></div><div class="ab cb qd qe qf qg" role="separator"><span class="qh by bm qi qj qk"/><span class="qh by bm qi qj qk"/><span class="qh by bm qi qj"/></div><div class="fj fk fl fm fn"><div class="ab cb"><div class="ci bh ev ew ex ey"><p id="0c57" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Read more of my work at <a class="af nc" href="http://www.stephaniekirmer.com." rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">www.stephaniekirmer.com.</a></p></div></div></div><div class="ab cb qd qe qf qg" role="separator"><span class="qh by bm qi qj qk"/><span class="qh by bm qi qj qk"/><span class="qh by bm qi qj"/></div><div class="fj fk fl fm fn"><div class="ab cb"><div class="ci bh ev ew ex ey"><h1 id="761f" class="od oe fq bf of og ql gq oi oj qm gt ol om qn oo op oq qo os ot ou qp ow ox oy bk">Further Reading</h1><div class="qq qr qs qt qu qv"><a href="https://www.inclusionhub.com/articles/inclusive-job-descriptions?source=post_page-----bd98f29c75cb--------------------------------" rel="noopener  ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><div class="qw ab ig"><div class="qx ab co cb qy qz"><h2 class="bf fr hw z io ra iq ir rb it iv fp bk">DEI Hiring: How to Create Inclusive Job Descriptions</h2><div class="rc l"><h3 class="bf b hw z io ra iq ir rb it iv dx">Finding the right candidate for the job starts with the right job description.
