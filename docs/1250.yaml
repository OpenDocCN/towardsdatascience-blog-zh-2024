    focus on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML) models, their size
    and performance, their rapid evolution, their training costs, their security,
    their latency, and the various model hosting choices in the cloud, locally, and
    at the edge. One overlooked area has been the ***Final Mile*** product User Experience
    (UX), and how best to incorporate AIML into products.
  prefs: []

- en: This blog post describes several practices for “*what good looks like*” in AIML
    UX, suggests reference examples, and maps a path forward for product managers
    and leaders who are shaping the future of their products and businesses. I also
    take the unique ךens of dually aligning these practices with [Amazon Leadership
    Principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles)
    (LP) as well as UX principles articulated by Dr Don Norman and Steve Krug who
    authored *The Design of Everyday Things* and *Don’t Make Me Think*, respectively.
    Together, these principles and practices provide a solid foundation for understanding
    the ***Why*** for recommending specific UX actions and ideas when building AIML
    solutions.

    are surfaced to customers in a manner that is convenient, easy to use, discoverable,
    and visible. ***Visibility*** is critical in UX design, and it aligns with the
    Amazon LP of ***Invent and Simplify*** which all suggests that the features should
    be readily accessible at the *surface of attention and consciousness* and without
    a lot of fussing, fumbling, searching, and struggling. Whether it is content,
    conversation, or contacts, delivering the right information to the right person
    at the right time is essential here, so now let’s see what good looks like.

    embeds generative AI features directly into the UX of Docs, Mail and other Google
    apps, making it easier for users to start drafting new documents and summarizing
    existing ones whether it’s a short memo, longer paper, or a dynamic presentation.
    In the case of Google Docs, the content is generated below the prompt, and it
    is also made clear that it was generated by the AIML model with the *star* (*******)
    symbol. This motif of denoting something as produced by AIML will show up frequently
    throughout the examples.

    which allows you to personalize search results as well as summarize channel activity
    and long, complex threads. In this case, the generated content is displayed in
    a compact right hand panel as contextual details enriching the main pane. It is
    convenient, does not overload the user, and is also clearly marked as AI-generated.

    According to Amazon, 125 million customers contributed nearly 1.5 billion reviews
    and ratings to Amazon.com in 2022 alone; some individual products have 1000s of
    reviews. So in the spirit of helping a customer understand whether a product is
    right for them, Amazon.com provides a short paragraph on the product detail page
    that highlights the product features and customer sentiment frequently mentioned
    across reviews. The AI-generated review also highlights key product attributes
    and allows customers to more easily surface specific human reviews that mention
    certain those product attributes. Again, the AI-content is compact, clearly marked
    as machine-generated, and some aspects are visually iconified.

    believe you, then consider getting your source “***on the record***” and getting
    their consent so that “***you can quote them on that***”. Citing bibliographic
    sources is a common practice in academic and scientific writing. The purpose of
    this practice is **Earning Trust,** one ofthe Amazon LPs, as well as **Helpfulness**,
    another UX principle. The practice is best illustrated through some good examples
    of how others are providing citations.

    which is not load balancing correctly across multiple destination nodes and is
    only caching 1 IP address incorrectly. Please provide detailed, step-by-step prescriptive
    guidance.*” Note in the response below that there are the multiple sources listed
    at the top and the numeric citations (e.g. *[1]*) sprinkled throughout referencing
    said sources.

    question “*I am planning to create Serverless APIs with 100k requests per day.
    Each request needs to read data from the database. What are the best services
    for this workload?*” Once again, the service answered my question and also provided
    the Sources, however they are suffixed to the response, and while numerically
    ordered the actual references are not identified within the response for the reader’s
    benefit. I also commend the clear link to the Responsible AI policy which is another
    mechanism for earning trust. Which approach is clearer to read and to understand
    depends upon the context of your specific application. Do the citations clarify?
    Do they distract? Where are they best placed?

    underway from static user interfaces to ***dynamic conversational interfaces***.
    Traditional GUIs whether they resided on mainframes, desktops, web, or mobile
    have been mostly composed of windows, tabs, panels, forms, grids, checkboxes,
    text fields, list selectors, and buttons. Although these [UX patterns](https://ui-patterns.com/)
    have been enormously successful for enabling more of humanity to interact with
    computers, we must recognize that we had to teach ourselves to work with computers.

    interfaces, and there have been some [commercial successes](https://think.design/blog/interaction-design-evolution-part-2/)
    such as Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, and Google Assistant. However, this conversational
    UX trend is now changing mainstream applications beyond Big Tech in both consumer
    and business settings. Digital chatbots and assistants are the most obvious examples,
    and the illustrated [Amazon Rufus](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-rufus)
    retail assistant above demonstrates the change underway from traditional search
    to conversation. In this case, Rufus knows about the consumer, the Amazon product
    catalog, and has a mental model about the world at large, and can help make recommendations,
    inform users about products, compare products across brands and categories, and
    so on. Some [principles of conversational design](https://uxmag.com/articles/7-principles-of-conversational-design-banner)
    include *1/providing contextualized prompts to engage*, *2/assigning personas
    to give emotive tones to text*, and *3/sharing historical memory to build relationships
    and earn trust based on past usage*. More attention and care is needed to [validate](https://www.zendesk.com/blog/conversational-ux/)
    which prompt variables are mandatory versus optional. You may need to also prompt
    the user to capture more information and confirm what is about to be done before
    performing more actions on their behalf. You also need to account for conversational
    hiccups and misunderstandings.

    how businesses can incorporate this technology into their products or services.
    This **Keep the Conversation** practice is aligned with the Amazon LP of **Customer
    Obsession** and UX principle of **Flexibility**.

    outcomes](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/product-ux-benchmarks/). This practice
    is aligned with the Amazon LP of ***Learn and Be Curious***, and the UX principle
    of ***Feedback***. You cannot know everything inside a user’s mind, so ask them.
    Track and measure them, and then align the gathered data with outcomes. Think
    about optimizing e-commerce shopping cart experiences to increase orders and reduce
    pending carts, also referred to as conversion rates. Consider time spent and clicks
    on a site as a proxy for user engagement. Reflect when you onboard onto any new
    system. The first few clicks, steps and minutes of onboarding are crucial to maximizing
    the task success rate and reducing the error rate. Now put these ideas into the
    context of Generative AI which is relatively new to public facing products in
    both business and consumer scenarios. Some common approaches to this practice
    include actions for Like/Dislike and Sharing to Support.

    illustrates this practice having first class buttons for Like / Dislike. The other
    commendable aspect is the clear italicized message that “*AI-generated content
    may be incorrect*”. That also earns trust as well.'

    where you are going, then any road will take you there*. Supporting these core
    UX practices for AIML is good, old-fashioned [product road mapping](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-roadmaps-faq/),
    and there are no shortcuts to arriving at this Big Picture. The principles supporting
    this practice are the Amazon LP, ***Think Big***, and UX principle for ***Consistency***.
    Identify your target users, product use cases, and their goals. And then work
    backwards. At Amazon, we often draft a [PRFAQ](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/an-insider-look-at-amazons-culture-and-processes)
    document to imagine what the future ought to be and think about it from the external
    PR aspect and the internal FAQ detailed aspect. Think about the high-level solution
    information and processes needed to achieve the customer goals. Then dive deeper
    into the solution components at the UX layer and other technology layers. Align
    and prioritize solution and component milestones based on risk, ROI, must-have
    vs nice-to-have, and other factors. Get consensus across the product, engineering,
    and sales teams. And then go execute according to the roadmap with the proviso
    that some adjustments will be made along the journey.

    product examples from top technology companies including Amazon, Google, Microsoft,
    Perplexity, Salesforce, and Slack to illustrate these practices and principles.
    I hope you learned something new that you can immediately incorporate into your
    own products and solution. Go forth and build!'
