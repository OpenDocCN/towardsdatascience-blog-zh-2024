    to complex problems and produce quality work in record time.
  prefs: []

    from there, they know exactly which process to follow, which query to write, which
    dataset to use, and how to make the insights as digestible as possible.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: SQL is the language of data analysis. It is critical to be fluent in it to be
    able to delve and derive deeper insights. And by fluency, I don’t mean proficiency
    — I truly mean fluency, i.e. not thinking twice before putting together a 100-line
    script with multiple CTEs, using arrays and window functions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The lack of fluency in SQL can greatly limit an analyst. Either they become
    dependent on others for data retrieval — which greatly limits their execution
    speed — or if they are only relying on their skills, they become forced to stay
    at the “surface” of insights, potentially missing the deeper, valuable truths
    beneath.

- en: When working with data, it is easy to feel like “you understand” the machinery.
    You know the numbers. You know the trends. But without the domain knowledge, i.e.
    without the qualitative side, it is easy to miss some key insights. Because at
    the end of the day, a dataset is just a simplification. It offers a limited and
    simplified lens to look at a phenomenon. Domain knowledge is what gives the additional
    context needed to understand what cannot be seen in the dataset itself.
