- en: Through this article, I aim to introduce you to a growingly popular deep learning
    algorithm, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs are gradually emerging from the
    realm of research and are already demonstrating impressive results on real-world
    problems, suggesting their vast potential. The main objective of this article
    is to demystify this algorithm. If, by the end, you can answer questions like,
    Why would I use a GNN? How does a GNN work? I would consider my mission accomplished.

    domains. Particularly in computer science, a graph is a data structure composed
    of two elements: a set of vertices, or nodes, and a set of edges connecting these
    nodes.'

    edges have a direction, as shown below.
