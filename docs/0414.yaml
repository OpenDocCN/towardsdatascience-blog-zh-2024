- en: It was around 1689 that one of biggest discoveries in probability unfolded in
    the Swiss Confederation. The protagonist was **Jacob Bernoulli** and the discovery
    was the [**Weak Law of Large Numbers**](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/on-jacob-bernoulli-the-law-of-large-numbers-and-the-origins-of-the-central-limit-theorem-8101bc6104e1)**.**
    Bernoulli showed that **the mean of a randomly selected sample converges in probability
    to the mean of the population**. Unfortunately, Bernoulli proved the WLLN in the
    context of a [Binomial experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution)
    and in the 1600s, there was not one soul in Europe who knew how to efficiently
    approximate, leave alone calculate, the big, bulky factorials that constitute
    binomial probabilities. And that meant that for all its ground-breaking importance,
    the Weak Law of Large Numbers enjoyed little practical utility.

    a self-exiled Frenchman in England by the name **Abraham De Moivre** would crack
    the problem of binomial approximation, and in doing so gift us the normal distribution
    curve.
