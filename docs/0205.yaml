- en: During my career as a Data Scientist, I’ve attended many conferences and meetups.
    When I started my job, many were struggling to understand what Data Science was
    and how to leverage the growing cloud computing solutions. **It always felt like
    a jungle!**

    events became essential for me. At some point, someone invited me to present a
    project I was working on. It was then I realized how much I enjoy sharing and
    explaining my work!

    [ODSC](https://odsc.com/california/), [PyCon](https://python.ie/pycon-2023/),
    and [Data Innovation Summit](https://datainnovationsummit.com/), among others.

    pushing data enthusiasts to find solutions for problems that sometimes just can’t
    be solved. **Now, imagine how helpful it would be to connect with someone facing
    the same challenges, who might offer the very answer you’ve been seeking**. Or
    perhaps simply someone you can relate to, where you can share and delve deeply
    into the work you’re doing.'

    recall when this amazing Data Engineer shared how he resolved a deployment issue
    with AWS Lambda during his presentation. This issue had been a challenge for me
    for several weeks.

    It’s a way to discover certain solutions and understand how they can be applied.
    Moreover, if you’re truly passionate about your work, presenting your ideas and
    opening them up for discussion can be immensely enjoyable. It’s an opportunity
    to receive feedback from a diverse array of people.
  prefs: []

    Models (LLMs), has significantly advanced, there’s an increasing need for enhanced
    communication. This is crucial to explain the layers of complexity that exist
    between us and the technologies that have become part of our lives.

    especially when you’re immersed in the world of data every day. You’re surrounded
    by stories and challenges that defy simple, deterministic solutions. To me, that’s
    the perfect starting point for something extraordinary!
  prefs: []

    of our daily conversations. We discuss it with our boss, colleagues, and forget
    that outside our bubble, many companies and individuals are still navigating the
    basics of data and AI. For example, I know many who aren’t familiar with ChatGPT,
    despite its growing popularity. Take your insights beyond your immediate circle,
    and you’ll realize how vast your audience truly is!

    to work in this field without transforming complex contexts into more digestible
    narratives. You might be doing it subconsciously, but you’re definitely doing
    it.

    the audience, the speaker, and the organizers. If your presentation doesn’t add
    value for these three key groups, it’s wise to step back and reassess its purpose.

    could be something you’ve dedicated months to, leading to a realization that it’s
    worth sharing. Whether it’s about your successful solutions or your failures (and
    the lessons learned), it should stem from your personal expertise and diligent
    effort.

    true experts. When you think about taking the stage, view it as a platform for
    sharing knowledge rather than as a destination or a crowning achievement. The
    term “Guru” isn’t inherently negative, but in this context, I want to emphasize
    the distinction I’m making.

    following step involves researching who else is discussing similar topics, through
    various channels like publications, talks, or Medium articles. This stage is vital
    as it requires a thorough understanding of current trends and developments, ensuring
    that my contribution stands out in some unique way.

    I wrote a few years back. I wasn’t introducing something brand new; instead, the
    innovation lay in how I combined existing technologies to overcome a specific
    challenge. This experience then became the focus of a talk I gave to a local Python
    community in Hamburg.

    open to contrary views, though I’m quite steadfast in my belief! Instead of relying
    heavily on text, I suggest using visuals that succinctly explain your algorithm
    or employing brief bullet points as your guide. When presenting to an audience
    that may not be as deeply immersed in the subject as you are and has likely sat
    through other presentations, overloading them with text can be counterproductive.
    The result? A disengaged audience and the feeling that your message isn’t getting
    through. Just picture enduring a 30-minute presentation under such conditions!
  prefs: []

    the crucial elements that complement your talk. Understand that it’s impossible
    to cover every detail. Instead, provide a few links to your work for those in
    the audience who wish to explore the topic further.

    to give credit for original content, as this isn’t about competition. By recognizing

    demonstrating a thorough understanding of the subject matter.

- en: This is your moment to truly stand out, after all the effort you’ve put into
    your subject! Aim to captivate everyone’s attention. Ensure the experts in the
    room are pleased to hear about familiar topics, while those less knowledgeable
    feel included and able to grasp your points. Be observant of your audience; gauge
    whether they are keeping up with you. If time allows, lighten the mood with a
    joke to ease both your nerves and theirs. Engage your audience directly by asking
    a few questions during your talk to maintain high levels of attention.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I view this as a strategic game where you must actively prevent the audience’s
    attention from waning. Incorporate as many additional details as possible to help
    the audience connect with you and the problem you tackled. This might include
    some background on your company or what methods were used before your solution
    came into play.

    to memory? In my view, that’s a matter of personal preference. Personally, I tend
    not to. This is mainly because I prefer to let the flow of ideas guide my presentation,
    allowing me to spontaneously include thoughts I might not have initially considered.
    This approach, largely driven through experience, makes the whole process much
    more enjoyable, in my opinion.'

    battle was against imposter syndrome. This feeling seems to be a common thread
    among data scientists. Hence, stepping out to talk about a project that’s somewhat
    nebulous or didn’t quite work out as expected can be quite challenging. Thankfully,
    I overcame my apprehensions, and thanks to numerous incredible speakers I’ve encountered
    along my journey, I’ve been able to look back at my achievements and recognize
    that many are indeed worth sharing.

    step out, and share them with the world.
