    Yes, you read that right. We’re at our desks for eight or more hours, but a lot
    of that time is spent on things that aren’t related to work, like scrolling through
    social media and talking with coworkers. Even when we try to focus, it’s not always
    easy with all the constant distractions we are exposed to.

    so hard for me to concentrate for a long time. Then, I adopted two simple habits
    that increased my productivity by more than 50%. Not only are these habits easy
    to implement, but they work perfectly for data scientists or anyone who spends
    long hours in front of a computer.

    1905, at age 26, he had his [*annus mirabilis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annus_mirabilis_papers)(miraculous
    year)*.* In one year only, he published four groundbreaking papers that had a
    substantial impact on modern physics. In his fourth paper, he introduced the idea
    of mass-energy equivalence, commonly known as *E = mc²*.

    theoretical physics, especially for discovering the law of the photoelectric effect.
    His work changed the way scientists think and made significant technological progress
    possible in the 20th century and beyond.

    with *The Saturday Evening Post* in 1929, he famously said, “[Imagination is more
    important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagination#cite_note-58)”
    He believed in intuition and inspiration. In other words, he encouraged people
    to look beyond the current frontiers of what we know and be open to the unknown.

    nourish his imagination. He enjoyed long walks, sailing, and playing the violin.
    These activities gave him a chance to relax and free his mind. It was often during
    these moments that he found his best ideas and inspirations.

    himself [chasing after a beam of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%27s_thought_experiments#Pursuing_a_beam_of_light).
    He later recalled, in his [*Autobiographical Notes*](https://archive.org/stream/EinsteinAutobiography/EinsteinAutobiography_djvu.txt),
    that the thought experiment had played an important role in his development of
    special relativity.

    had multiple hobbies and interests. They allowed him to solve problems from different
    perspectives. His fascination with birds and their ability to fly led him to study
    the mechanics of flight in great detail, resulting in his sketches of ornithopters,
    a flying device.

    Like Einstein, da Vinci and Darwin, data scientists engage in intense intellectual

    20, or even 10 minutes, it’s a good start. For me, spending at least 30 minutes
    a day on something that disconnects me from work is ideal. What’s important is

    technology in graphics processing. NVIDIA made a bold bet on deep learning under
    his guidance at a time when the future and potential of artificial intelligence
    were uncertain.

    Huang was asked, “What advice would you give to Stanford students to improve their
    chances of success?” Instead of the usual “follow your dreams” answer, he emphasized
    the importance of resilience. Greatness comes from facing challenges. He even
    humorously wished the students “ample doses” of pain and suffering to shape their
    character.

    to recover from setbacks that truly makes a difference. This emphasis on resilience
    highlights the importance of mental strength in achieving success.

    that identifies psychological flexibility as the single most important skill for
    mental health and emotional well-being. Psychological flexibility involves the
    ability to stay present, open up to difficult experiences, and do what matters
    in alignment with one’s values—all crucial components of mental strength.

    part of the process.
