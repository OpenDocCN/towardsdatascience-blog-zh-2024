    success. Churn surveys, a specific type of survey designed for customers who have
    stopped using a service, are a treasure trove of customer insights. However, the
    true power lies in transforming those insights into concrete actions that boost
    sustainable growth and revenue. Churn often stems from unmet customer needs, leading
    to lost subscriptions and revenue. This article dives into a powerful technique:
    “*assigning a dollar value to customer problems identified through churn surveys.”*
    You can apply this method to other types of surveys, like CSAT, NPS, and other
    VOC tools. By quantifying the financial impact of these problems, you can prioritize
    which issues to tackle first, maximizing your profitability. Prioritization is
    the key to every product development process.'

    opportunity size would be 45,000*$20*12 = $10.8 million ARR (assuming the cost
    of the subscription per churn user is $20). This is revenue loss only in 1 year,
    in reality this would be more if customer do not churn then they pay for 3–5 years

    only for the population which is represented by the sample (segment users). And
    make efforts to find churn-related insights for the remaining demographic. Example:
    If you have an in-product churn survey and you have Small-Medium Business to Enterprise
    customers, then many times Enterprise customers do not churn in-product; they
    cancel subscriptions through renewal managers; hence, to get insights from them,
    incorporate a churn survey through the renewal manager path.'

    provides a starting point; it’s too general to develop effective solutions. To
    gain deeper insights, we can use a follow-up, branched question after users select
    “It’s too expensive” in the initial survey.

    are churning because of non-price-related issues like “*did not find the value”
    and* “*don’t need the subscription temporarily.”* That is why going one level
    deeper is important to understand the real issues. Now let’s look into calculating
    opportunity sizing for some of the above churn reasons:'

    1, but we need to keep in mind that certain users might be coming back automatically
    as they are canceling for temporary reasons. Hence, we need to remove those users
    from our calculation (organic win-back rate). So, if your organic win-back rate
    for this audience is 2%, then the final addressable ARR would be: (9000 * $20*12)
    — (9000* 2% * $20*12) = $2.2M ARR loss.'

- en: '**Potential Solutions:** Now, as we know, solving the above use case can save
    substantial revenue; hence, we can build the solution for these users. One solution
    could be introducing a pause subscription option. Since the reasons for canceling
    are temporary (like travel, unexpected weather, pandemics, or even just a busy
    period can disrupt users’ routines), pausing allows users to hold onto their subscription
    without the burden of ongoing fees. This benefits businesses in two ways: First,
    it fosters customer loyalty by demonstrating flexibility and understanding user
    needs. Second, it increases the chance of users returning to the service once
    their busy period or temporary disruption has passed, leading to continued revenue.'

    rates [[source](https://recurly.com/product/pause-subscription/)]. The famous
    audio book subscription service Audible offers a pause subscription.

    why. Do the same exercise as above to calculate the revenue you are losing because
    the user did not find the value in the subscription, i.e., 15700 * $20 * 12 =
    $3.78 million ARR. This is the revenue you can save because of the retention of
    these users. In addition to this, you will also be earning expansion revenue (if
    your business model has that option), as once users realize the value of the service,
    they are more likely to expand.

    and are churning to a competitor purely because of the lower price, offering them
    a discount in the cancellation flow is a good **option. Y**ou can save up to 20%
    of the ARR by building discounts in the cancellation flow. What discount to offer
    in the cancellation flow will depend on three factors: 1) Cost to serve the customer;
    2) Offer a take-up rate 3) Retention rate after the offer expires.'

    root cause allows us to develop targeted solutions that truly address user needs
