fj bk">In 1993, E.F. Codd &amp; Associates introduced the term OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) to describe techniques used for answering multidimensional analytical queries from various perspectives. OLAP primarily involves three key operations :</p><ul class=""><li id="2987" class="mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh bk">Roll-up : Summarizing data at higher levels of aggregation,</li><li id="13f9" class="mj mk fq ml b go ni mn mo gr nj mq mr ms nk mu mv mw nl my mz na nm nc nd ne nf ng nh bk">Drill-down : Navigating to more detailed levels of data,</li><li id="b7e3" class="mj mk fq ml b go ni mn mo gr nj mq mr ms nk mu mv mw nl my mz na nm nc nd ne nf ng nh bk">Slice and dice : Selecting and analyzing data from different viewpoints.</li></ul><p id="2626" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">Browsing the web nowadays, it feels like every data analytics issue is somehow tied to trendy self-service BI, focused on crunching Big Data with AI on steroids. Platforms like LinkedIn and Reddit are flooded with endless discussions about the disadvantages of outdated OLAP compared to the latest trends in data analytics for all. So yes, we can confidently declare: OLAP is dead. But wait… is it really?</p><figure class="nq nr ns nt nu nv nn no paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="nw nx ed ny bh nz"><div class="nn no np"><img src="../Images/c82d2252606777f9235f6b47f2f4f82e.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*-q505fHPP2gqYDZtuzaVbA.jpeg"/></div></div><figcaption class="ob oc od nn no oe of bf b bg z dx">RIP OLAP (Image by the author — AI generated)</figcaption></figure><p id="6298" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk"><strong class="ml fr">Who Am I and Why This Post ?</strong></p><p id="8935" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">Before we dive into that disputed subject, let me introduce myself and explain why I’m bothering you with this post. I work at <a class="af og" href="https://www.iccube.com/about" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">icCube</a>, where amongst others, I solve the technical challenges of our customers. Occasionally, the sales team asks me to join demos for potential clients, and almost, without fail, the central concern of data scalability comes up — to handle the (soon-to-be) Big Data of that customer. Being a technical and pragmatic person, my naive, non-sales response would be :</p><blockquote class="oh oi oj"><p id="2ff1" class="mj mk ok ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">Could we first please define the actual problems to see if we really need to talk about Big Data ?</p></blockquote><p id="763f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">Ouch ;-) Told you, I’m a techie at heart. So, in this post, I’d like to clarify what OLAP means in 2024 and the kinds of challenges it can solve. I’ll draw from my experience at icCube, so I might be a bit biased, but I’ll do my best to remain objective. Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments.</p><h1 id="98c2" class="ol om fq bf on oo op gq oq or os gt ot ou ov ow ox oy oz pa pb pc pd pe pf pg bk">OLAP != OLAP Cube</h1><p id="6c5e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go ph mn mo gr pi mq mr ms pj mu mv mw pk my mz na pl nc nd ne fj bk">OLAP is often, if not always, used interchangeably with OLAP Cube — i.e., a materialized structure of pre-aggregated values in a multidimensional space. With this wrong definition, it’s easy to see why people might say OLAP is outdated, as advances in technology have reduced the need for pre-aggregation.</p><p id="68a6" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">However, OLAP is not synonymous with OLAP Cubes. If there’s one thing I would highlight from the various definitions and discussions about OLAP, it’s that OLAP embodies a set of concepts and methods for efficiently analyzing multidimensional data.</p><p id="f71d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">Chris Webb captured this well in a post, reflecting back in the old days:</p><blockquote class="oh oi oj"><p id="f992" class="mj mk ok ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">By “OLAP” I mean the idea of a centralised model containing not just all your data but also things like how your tables should be joined, how measures aggregate up, advanced calculations and KPIs and so on.</p></blockquote><p id="06e2" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">In his post, “<a class="af og" href="https://blog.crossjoin.co.uk/2015/11/18/webinar-recording-is-olap-dead/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Is OLAP Dead</a>”, Chris Webb also referred to the <a class="af og" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100106080548/http://www.olapreport.com/FASMI.HTM" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">FASMI Test</a> as a way to qualify an OLAP system in just five keywords : “Fast Analysis of Shared Multidimensional Information”.</p><pre class="nq nr ns nt nu pm pn po bp pp bb bk"><span id="4924" class="pq om fq pn b bg pr ps l pt pu">FAST              : means that the system is targeted to deliver most<br/>                    responses to users within about five seconds, with the<br/>                    simplest analyses taking no more than one second and<br/>                    very few taking more than 20 seconds.<br/><br/>ANALYSIS          : means that the system can cope with any business logic <br/>                    and statistical analysis that is relevant for the<br/>                    application and the user, and keep it easy enough for<br/>                    the target user.<br/><br/>SHARED            : means that the system implements all the security<br/>                    requirements for confidentiality (possibly down to cell<br/>                    level).<br/><br/>MULTIDIMENSIONAL  : is our key requirement. If we had to pick a one-word<br/>                    definition of OLAP, this is it.

His conclusion :</p><blockquote class="oh oi oj"><p id="440f" class="mj mk ok ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">Big Data is real, but most people may not need to worry about it.

Surprisingly, a significant portion of this time is also spent communicating with the few individuals who possess knowledge of both the technical and business worlds. This is not surprising, as the data model typically evolves over many years, becomes increasingly complex, and people come and go.</p><p id="b28e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">But let’s assume the raw data is clean and the business users understand it perfectly. Then what happens when hundreds (or even thousands) of reports are created, likely accessing the OLTP databases (as there is no IT involvement in creating an analytical data repository)? Are they consistent with each other? Are they following the same business rules? Are they computing things right? Are they causing performance issues?</p><p id="ea44" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">And assuming all is fine, then how do you maintain these reports?

You no longer need your OLAP engine, and by the way, you no longer need any analytical tool. AI is here to rule them all!

Quite the contrary, in fact. We’ve recently introduced a chatbot widget to help end users understand their data. We’re actively investigating how to use AI to improve the productivity of our customers. The actual issues we’re facing with it are mainly:</p><ul class=""><li id="1b93" class="mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh bk">It’s not accurate enough to give to end users who cannot distinguish the hallucinations.</li><li id="9d94" class="mj mk fq ml b go ni mn mo gr nj mq mr ms nk mu mv mw nl my mz na nm nc nd ne nf ng nh bk">It’s overkill to give to end users who are expert in the domain and can understand and fix the hallucinations.</li><li id="4f62" class="mj mk fq ml b go ni mn mo gr nj mq mr ms nk mu mv mw nl my mz na nm nc nd ne nf ng nh bk">The cost of each query (that is the LLM inference cost).</li></ul><p id="4f67" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">But don’t just take my word for it — I’d like to highlight the practical and similar approach shared by Marco Russo. You can check out his YouTube video <a class="af og" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8DrFmsddgc" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>. For those short on time, skip ahead to the 32-minute mark where Marco is sharing his feelings about ChatGPT being used to generate DAX code.</p><p id="ec09" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">Right now, generative AI is not ready to replace any OLAP system and certainly cannot be used as an argument to say OLAP is dead.</p><p id="ab20" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">Now, let’s return to the FASMI Test and take a look at the five key terms that define an OLAP system.</p><h1 id="85e9" class="ol om fq bf on oo op gq oq or os gt ot ou ov ow ox oy oz pa pb pc pd pe pf pg bk">FASMI Test : Fast</h1><pre class="nq nr ns nt nu pm pn po bp pp bb bk"><span id="af82" class="pq om fq pn b bg pr ps l pt pu">means that the system is targeted to deliver most responses to users<br/>within about five seconds, with the simplest analyses taking no more than<br/>one second and very few taking more than 20 seconds.</span></pre><p id="d9c5" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">Delivering fast response time to analytical queries is no longer exclusive to OLAP systems. However, it remains an added benefit of OLAP systems, which are specifically tailored for such queries. One significant advantage is that it helps avoid overloading OLTP databases (or any actual sources of data) because :</p><ul class=""><li id="fb82" class="mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh bk">A dedicated data warehouse may have been created.</li><li id="99e3" class="mj mk fq ml b go ni mn mo gr nj mq mr ms nk mu mv mw nl my mz na nm nc nd ne nf ng nh bk">It may act as a cache in front of the actual data sources.</li></ul><p id="af01" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">An additional benefit of this intermediate layer is that it can help reduce the costs associated with accessing the underlying raw data.</p><h1 id="a47c" class="ol om fq bf on oo op gq oq or os gt ot ou ov ow ox oy oz pa pb pc pd pe pf pg bk">FASMI Test : Analysis</h1><pre class="nq nr ns nt nu pm pn po bp pp bb bk"><span id="75e7" class="pq om fq pn b bg pr ps l pt pu">means that the system can cope with any business logic and statistical<br/>analysis that is relevant for the application and the user, and keep it<br/>easy enough for the target user.</span></pre><p id="c9e0" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">OLAP systems are designed to perform complex analytical queries and, as such, offer a range of features that are often not available out of the box in other systems. Some of these features include :</p><ul class=""><li id="3914" class="mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh bk">Slice-and-dice capabilities : allows users to explore data from different perspectives and dimensions.</li><li id="6a50" class="mj mk fq ml b go ni mn mo gr nj mq mr ms nk mu mv mw nl my mz na nm nc nd ne nf ng nh bk">Natural navigation : supports intuitive navigation through parent/child hierarchies in the multidimensional model.</li><li id="6276" class="mj mk fq ml b go ni mn mo gr nj mq mr ms nk mu mv mw nl my mz na nm nc nd ne nf ng nh bk">Aggregation measures : supports various aggregations such as sum, min, max, opening, closing values, and more.</li></ul><p id="7b37" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">To support all these capabilities, a specialized query language is needed. MDX (Multi-Dimensional Expressions) is the de facto standard for multidimensional analysis.</p><p id="8b71" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">Some advanced and possibly non-standard features that we frequently use with our customers are :</p><ul class=""><li id="d931" class="mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh bk">Time period comparisons : facilitates time-based analyses like year-over-year comparisons.</li><li id="2087" class="mj mk fq ml b go ni mn mo gr nj mq mr ms nk mu mv mw nl my mz na nm nc nd ne nf ng nh bk">Calculated measures : enables the creation of ad-hoc calculations at design or runtime.</li><li id="8499" class="mj mk fq ml b go ni mn mo gr nj mq mr ms nk mu mv mw nl my mz na nm nc nd ne nf ng nh bk">Calculated members : similar to calculated measures but can be applied to any dimension.

In every customer model where security is needed, defining proper authorization becomes a significant challenge.</p><p id="23cd" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">I would suggest improving the FASMI Test by making cell-level granularity mandatory.</p><p id="2cdd" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">Both Microsoft Analysis Services, icCube, and potentially other platforms allow security to be defined directly within the multidimensional model using the MDX language (introduced in the next point). This approach is quite natural and often aligns naturally with corporate hierarchical security structures.</p><p id="029b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">Defining security at the multidimensional model level is particularly important when the model is built from multiple data sources.

Many OLAP systems, including Microsoft Analysis Services and icCube, now support the dynamic creation of security profiles at runtime — once users are authenticated — based on various user attributes. Once this security template is defined, it will be applied on-the-fly each time a user logs into the system.</p><h1 id="215e" class="ol om fq bf on oo op gq oq or os gt ot ou ov ow ox oy oz pa pb pc pd pe pf pg bk">FASMI Test : Multidimensional</h1><pre class="nq nr ns nt nu pm pn po bp pp bb bk"><span id="7ac3" class="pq om fq pn b bg pr ps l pt pu">is our key requirement.

A multidimensional model is essential for data analytics because it offers a structured approach to analyzing complex data from multiple perspectives (data doesn’t exist in isolation) and often aligns with corporate hierarchical security frameworks.</p><p id="1ae9" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk"><strong class="ml fr">Intuitive for Business Users</strong></p><p id="154d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">This model mirrors how businesses naturally think about their data — whether it’s products, customers, or time periods.

Data sources tend to be messy, evolving over time with inconsistencies that add complexity. Accessing raw data can be challenging with traditional SQL-based approaches. Given the shortage of skilled talent, it’s wise to first establish a clean semantic layer, ensuring data is used correctly and that future data-driven decisions are well-informed.</p><p id="8266" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk"><strong class="ml fr">Trust and Reliability in Analytics</strong></p><p id="55b5" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">One major advantage of a well-defined multidimensional model (or semantic layer) is the trust it fosters in the analytics provided to customers.

In many cases, this “inflexibility” is more perceived than real. Modern OLAP tools, like icCube, don’t rely on outdated, cumbersome processes for creating OLAP cubes and can even support incremental updates. For example, icCube’s category feature allows even new dimensions to be created at runtime.</p><p id="7488" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">In summary, OLAP and dimensional models continue to offer critical advantages in handling complex business logic, security, despite the perceived inflexibility when compared to direct raw data access.</p><h1 id="7e0d" class="ol om fq bf on oo op gq oq or os gt ot ou ov ow ox oy oz pa pb pc pd pe pf pg bk">FASMI Test : Information</h1><pre class="nq nr ns nt nu pm pn po bp pp bb bk"><span id="e6cc" class="pq om fq pn b bg pr ps l pt pu">is all of the data and derived information needed, wherever it is and<br/>however much is relevant for the application.</span></pre><p id="a037" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">Pulling data from various sources — whether SQL, NoSQL, IoT, files, or SaaS platforms — is no longer something exclusive to OLAP systems.
