    Imagine that, in order to tell you the reason for your pain, the doctor needs
    to run a numerical simulation. This numerical simulation solves the differential
    equation of your body and the approximation error is so low that it results in
    basically 100% accuracy: you will know **exactly** why you have that abdominal
    pain, with no room for error at all (I know this sounds crazy, but bear with me
    here). ***Would you use the numerical simulation?*** Of course you would, why
    not?'

    differential equations, to get the response from the computer you need to wait
    **35 years of GPU runtime.** This would immediately drop the attractiveness of
    the method. What is the use of this method if it takes so long to get the response
    out of it? Sure, it might be 100% accurate, but the computational cost to pay
    is too large.

    modelling**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogate_model#:~:text=A%20surrogate%20model%20is%20an,the%20outcome%20is%20used%20instead.).
    As the name says, the approach is to use a ***surrogate*** of the original simulation…
