    the competitive advantage it could yield or from a healthy level of encouragement
    from their executives and investors. But out-of-the-box models lacked the nuance
    and understanding of a company’s processes, domain knowledge, business rules,
    and documentation. Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) was introduced to solve
    for this gap and provide a way to keep information that the language model could
    use as context from going stale.

- en: When competitive open-source models that could rival OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 started
    to emerge, it opened the floodgates for a flurry of possible technical developments.
    Suddenly, there was more flexibility and visibility for building tools that could
    advance the capabilities of the types of tasks language models were able to complete.

- en: Model orchestration libraries like Semantic Kernel, Autogen, and LangChain started
    to catch on, and the role of the AI engineer expanded. More development skills,
    proficiency with object-oriented programming, and familiarity with how to scale
    AI solutions into business processes were necessary to take full advantage of
    using these developer tools.

- en: The game really changed when AI started interacting with external systems. In
    2022, the Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language (MRKL) system was introduced.
    This system was the first to combine language models, external knowledge sources,
    and discrete reasoning — giving way to more opportunities to build AI systems
    that can take action to affect the outside world.

- en: But by 2023, we had more formalized tools like ChatGPT plugins, semantic functions,
    and other tools that could be called and utilized by language models. This opened
    up a whole new dimension of possibilities and shifted the role of the applied
    data scientist and AI Engineer to lean more development heavy. This meant that
    now they were responsible not only for the inner workings of the AI model, but
    also writing the code that enabled the model to interact with internal systems
    and perform real-world actions.

    above the AI Engineer/Data Scientist level, and the complex design choices are
    handled by management or even senior management. But the amount of creative freedom
    necessary for creating a successful agent system has caused a downward shift in
    the amount of design liberties and responsibility for the engineer.
