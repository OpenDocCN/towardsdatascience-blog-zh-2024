- en: Water cooler small talk is a special kind of small talk, typically observed
    in office spaces, particularly around a water cooler. There, much like contemporary
    cavemen gathered around a fire, employees frequently gather and share all kinds
    of corporate gossip, myths, and legends, inaccurate scientific opinions, indiscreet
    personal anecdotes, or outright lies. Anything goes. So, in this post, I discuss
    a water cooler scientific opinion I overheard the other day that literally left
    me speechless.

    gambling â€” doubling your bet each time to cover all previous losses â€” you will
    eventually win. In other words, if you lose, say, 100 times, your luck is going
    to eventually turn around, and youâ€™ll win â€” and this is supposedly a good strategy.â€™*'

    different ways. In reality, itâ€™s a terrible strategy â€” so terrible that there
    even are specific terms in culture and mathematics to describe just howâ€¦
