- en: Open source has fundamentally transformed the landscape of software development
    in the past couple of decades, especially in recent years, where Python has arguably
    dominated the field over all other languages (I’m sure there is scientific, mathematical
    proof for this in a paper somewhere). Being an incredibly easy language to learn,
    with its “[batteries included](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html#batteries-included)”
    philosophy, it has brought along a ton of remarkable open-source packages in the
    world of data, ranging from scientific computing and simulations, to numerical
    analysis and machine learning, to AI and chatbot development these days.

    A lot of the packages and scientific code in my area of research were written
    in a language called [Interactive Data Language (IDL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDL_(programming_language)).
    You may be surprised to learn that **this language was not free** — we had to
    pay a license fee for it. Yes, you read that right, **we had to pay to code**!

    programming language, but as a platform where anyone can contribute and create
    amazing…
