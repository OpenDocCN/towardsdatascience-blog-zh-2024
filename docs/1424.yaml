    into their tools, particularly in the data and analytics sector. If you have scrolled
    through LinkedIn (or anywhere, really) long enough, you have likely encountered
    these terms, often used interchangeably.

    you’re not alone. However, as you consider bringing these AI-powered systems into
    your organization, it’s essential to have a clear understanding of their distinct
    capabilities and use cases. By taking the time to learn the differences between
    these three concepts, you’ll be better positioned to select the right technology.

    They studied the different levels of autonomy in AI-powered tools to understand
    what distinguishes assistants, copilots, and agents. They found that the key difference
    lies in a single variable — the level of autonomy. AI assistants have low agency
    and autonomy, AI agents are proactive and autonomous, and copilots fall somewhere
    in between. The image below illustrates these differences.

    the primary concern for most companies. AI systems with low agency are an excellent
    way to augment work and help stakeholders answer data questions when they already
    know which questions to ask. However, in many organizations, the majority stakeholders
    are unsure of which data questions to ask or how to use the answers effectively.
    This is where companies aim to implement systems with greater agency and autonomy,
    which can act as prescriptive companions to stakeholders.

    and agents and how they ultimately affect the business value each can bring to
    the enterprise. My goal is to help you differentiate between these technologies
    when implementing them.

    hand, not only enhance productivity but also provide valuable support in the decision-making

    the model to break down a complex task into smaller, more manageable steps and
    then execute those steps sequentially. A large breakthrough in this area was the
    introduction of “ [Chain of Thought Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903)”.
    This approach allows language models to decompose multi-step problems into intermediate
    stages, mimicking a “thinking process” to solve the problem.

    adoption of analytics in enterprises has remained stagnant for 20 years, hovering
    between 20% and 30%. A staggering 70% of people in organizations do not know what
    questions to ask or what to do with the answers. AI agents are the systems closest
    to influencing decision making. They are autonomous enough to define goals, analyze
    their environment, and engage in **prescriptive analytics** — which is what organizations
    need the most.
