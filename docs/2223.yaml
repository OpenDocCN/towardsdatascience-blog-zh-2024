    as if its sole purpose of existence is to create tasks for us to solve, this post
    is probably for you.

- en: This section is here to refresh some basic knowledge. The first thing is the
    definition of **series and sequences**. A finite series is obtained by adding
    up the terms of a finite sequence. But in the context of real analysis, those
    finite series are usually left behind since without infinity, it doesn’t make
    sense to talk about convergence, rates of convergence, etc., which is fundamental
    in real analysis.

    from an endless series. The sum up to any specified term is called a **partial
    sum**. [2]

    that follow a particular pattern and looks like this: *a_1*, *a_2*, *a_3*, …*a_n*.
    But it’s useful to think about it as a **function**, this gives the formal definition
    of sequence:'

    (so 0 is included), and ℝ is the set of all the real numbers.'
