    Purpose, Impact, and Effort associated with their work. Before heading into the
    complex world of data analysis and modelling, it’s important to pause and evaluate
    the fundamental questions: **What is the purpose of this endeavour? What impact
    will it ultimately have? And is it worth the effort?**'

    crucial question you must continuously ask yourself is “How much additional value
    does the organization gain by utilising data science?”
  prefs: []

- en: Surprisingly, the answer to this question is not always straightforward. Sometimes,
    choosing a ‘quick and dirty’ solution — in line with the Pareto Principle, where
    20% of the effort yields 80% of the results — solves most everyday problems, so
    why spend the extra time and effort if a simpler solution can suffice?

    data science techniques lies an important decision: Is the marginal benefit of

    most cases, the answer is a resounding “no.”'

- en: Many courses and textbooks usually focus on teaching various time series forecasting
    techniques, often presenting them as the key ingredient for success. However,
    as experience has taught me in the real world, the real “secret weapon” is not
    in the model itself, but **deeply understanding the data you’re working with**.
    There is no one-size-fits-all forecasting model.

- en: For example, imagine trying to build your dream house on a foundation of loose
    sand. You can approach the best architects and builders, and create the most intricate
    blueprint, but ultimately the house is destined for disaster. Similarly, building
    a robust forecasting model with irrelevant data or riddled with errors and inconsistencies
    is like building on unstable ground. The model’s outputs will be unreliable and
    prone to collapse.

- en: Domain knowledge, in the context of time series forecasting, is more than just
    knowing what the data represents. It’s about digging in deeply and understanding
    the underlying relationships, mechanisms, and nuances specific to the problem
    you’re analysing. Each dataset is unique and your investigation into understanding
    the data will vary with every project.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While this step can seem quite boring, it can make or break the entire project.
    From informing feature engineering decisions to guiding model selection, domain
    knowledge plays a very important role in shaping the project. If you’re able to
    find and utilise the best data to feed into the model, your output would be considerably
    more useful.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you first learn about Time Series forecasting, you’ll often encounter the
    core assumption of “Stationarity” in lots of forecasting models. However, in the
    real world, Time series data rarely conforms to this assumption. Instead, you’ll
    find that the data and interactions change over time. This is usually characterized
    by fluctuations, trends, and seasonality. When building a reliable forecasting
    model, it is important to **identify and accommodate these dynamic patterns to
    accurately capture and predict the underlying trends and behaviour.**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another common problem is when sudden shifts or discontinuities occur in the
    data. Traditional forecasting methods don’t handle these sorts of shifts very
    well, but it is important to take these into consideration. These breaks can be
    a result of external factors ranging from changes in market conditions, shifts
    in consumer behaviour, or the introduction of new regulations or technologies.
    They may not always be directly measurable or available, but this is where your
    expertise would come into play here in finding the best way to account for these
    nuances.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, imagine you’re trying to predict the number of viewers of the English
    Premier League football. Apart from the obvious on/off-season, there are a few
    other quirks that happen, such as a high seasonal effect towards the end of the
    season where the stakes are higher, and viewers become more interested. Now imagine
    Messi moves to the Premier League or Sky Sports increase their monthly subscription
    fee — these sudden shifts are sometimes unpredictable but impacts the actual viewership
    quite significantly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There’s no easy way to handle these shifts, but there are techniques that can
    help. Here are a few approaches that I typically use to address these nuances,
    but the application of them is highly dependent on the nature of the data;
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 1\. **Time series decomposition** — This involves separating the data into its
    core components — such as trend, seasonality, and noise. This step should typically
    be done as part of the pre-analysis to better understand the data and model each
    component’s behaviour individually.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2\. **Exogenous features** — These are the external variables that you think
    affect the short-term volatility or the long-term trends of the data. This can
    be manual flags or the other important features to use as regressors. Domain Knowledge
    is crucial here. For each sudden shift, there is usually an explanation. It’s
    not always possible to incorporate each explanation as a feature, so it’s important
    to filter through the most useful, reliable, and predictable ones to avoid overfitting.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 3\. **Adaptive Modelling** — This involves selecting the most appropriate model
    that can detect and adapt to shifts in the underlying patterns. This step is one
    of my favourites as it involves research in finding or creating the best model
    for the data. However, it’s easier said than done. There may be times where this
    may involve some manual work, such as hyperparameter tuning or utilising a specific
    model that considers certain nuances of the data. Keep in mind that this may also
    increase the risk of overfitting.

    do prepare us more for them and build more robust forecasting models.

- en: Successful implementation of a model goes far beyond the technical intricacies
    of model selection and data analysis — it encompasses effective stakeholder management.
    Think of ‘Stakeholder Management’ as tailoring the process to the people involved.
    The goal is to ensure that your model is doing what it needs to do, and you continue
    to bring value. How you tailor the process and output depends on the needs of
    the stakeholders, whether this is executives, managers or consumers. It’s all
    about delivering actionable insights that enable them to make informed decisions**.**

- en: As a data scientist, your worth is often determined by how well you translate
    your technical insights into real-world decision-making. This is both a blessing
    and a curse to most of us — soft skills are notoriously undervalued in technical
    fields, but acts as the bridge between our mind-crunching work and the value than
    can be derived from it. While technical skills are important for the foundation
    for our work, your ability to communicate effectively, empathize with stakeholders,
    and drive action is what truly elevates our impact. Communication is the single
    most important skill as a data scientist, yet it is stereotypically also the most
    difficult to acquire.

    Data Scientists, but they’re often not transparent or easily interpretable, making
    it hard for stakeholders to trust the results. This is where it may be better
    to opt for simpler models like ARIMA or Exponential Smoothing where you may decrease
    accuracy but increase interpretability. It is always best to do research on the
    various models that exist.
