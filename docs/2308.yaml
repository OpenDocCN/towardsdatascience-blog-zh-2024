    dirty with data. At the beginning of a project, enthusiasm is at the top, but
    when things become complicated or too time-consuming, looking for simpler solutions
    is a real must.

- en: There may be situations where business stakeholders ask to make changes to the
    underlying solution logic or to make further adjustments/trials while trying to
    improve performance and maintain a good explicative level of the predictive algorithms
    involved. Identifying possible bottlenecks in the code implementation, which may
    lead to additional complexity and delays in delivering the final product, is crucial.

    model. We have all that we need easily at our disposal and after a while, we are
    ready to present to the business people our fancy predictive solutions built on
    thousands of features and millions of records that achieve astonishing performances.

    the technology's potential, but they added a request. They want to know how the
    model takes its decisions. Nothing easier we may think…
