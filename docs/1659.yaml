    provide a very simple overview of the basic mathematical logic used in training
    AI models. I promise that if you have a basic education, the following examples
    will be understandable, and you’ll gain a slightly better understanding of the
    field of artificial intelligence.

    revenue. We have data on the sales revenue of the past two months, advertising
    costs, and product prices.

    depends on the price of our product and the advertising expenses. Using such a
    tool, a marketing specialist could, for example, calculate the expected sales
    revenue if they spend €50 on advertising and set the product price at €6.

    m and n. In other words, we don’t know how much increasing advertising costs and

    For example, we initially set the advertising cost parameter to 2 and the price
    parameter to -2.

    by their respective parameter values, we see that our initial model is overly
    optimistic. In the first month, the actual sales revenue was €5, but our model
    predicted €30\. In the second month, the actual sales revenue was €18, and our
    model predicted €52.

    advertising cost and product price have positive value[.](https://tehisintellekt.ee/artiklid/keeruline-lihtsaks-matemaatika-millega-tehisintellekt-opib/)
    For instance, we reduce the advertising cost weight from 2 to 1 and the price
    parameter from -2 to -3.

    worked perfectly on the training data. To assess the model’s accuracy, it must

    as €28 (actual €24) and for April as €21 (actual €18). On average, our model makes
    an error of €3.5 on new data, which we can call the accuracy of our model.
