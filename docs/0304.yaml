    the capabilities of a product increase, so does its complexity. For users, this
    has often meant choosing between simplicity and power. Anyone who has grappled
    with advanced softwares knows the frustration of navigating through countless
    menus and options to find that one feature they need! It’s the classic trade-off
    that has, until now, dictated the user experience.'

    array of rich design features, the product became so complex that only experts
    could use it. Today, with generative AI, Photoshop can enable users to make requests
    in plain speech like “*remove background*” or “*make this portrait pop with sharper
    contrast*.” This is a glimpse into how AI is making powerful tools more accessible
    for everyone.'

    now make their user experience more accessible and intuitive for users without
    sacrificing their sophisticated capabilities. Conversely, the existing feature-light
    products aimed at novice users, which typically favor simple user experience,
    can now offer a newfound depth of Generative AI capabilities without adding complicating
    the user interface.

    believes that paradigm shift of Generative AI has kick started a race. In the

    strategies that product leaders are leveraging to use Generative AI for delivering

    images — which include pictures of pets, people, landmarks and every day objects.
    However, many practical vision applications (manufacturing, aerial imagery, life
    sciences, etc.) use images that look nothing like most internet images.

    Bloomberg trained an LLM with proprietary financial data to build [BloombergGPT](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/press/bloomberggpt-50-billion-parameter-llm-tuned-finance/),
    which outperforms other generic models of similar size on most finance NLP tasks.
    By augmenting foundation models with proprietary, in-domain data, companies can
    develop tailored generative AI that understands the nuances of the industry and
    delivers differentiated experience to meet users’ specialized needs.

- en: For all their impressive abilities, generative AI models are a far from being
    reliable enough for most real-world applications. This gap between “wow!” demos
    and dependable deployments is what technologists refer to as the “last mile” problem.
    Generative AI produces probabilistic output and have tendency to hallucinate.
    This is a cause of concern in many business, finance, medicine, and other high-stakes
    use cases. As generative models become more capable, implementing practices to
    ensure fairness, transparency, privacy, and security grows increasingly important.
