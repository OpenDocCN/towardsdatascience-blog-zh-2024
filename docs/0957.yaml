- en: Choosing a college major was difficult for me. It felt like the first step to
    committing to a career and I wanted a little of everything. I liked math and programming,
    but I also wanted a job that allowed me to be creative, gave me a platform for
    communication, and was versatile enough to explore different industries. After
    some research, the data science program at the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute
    (HDSI) at UC San Diego seemed like a good fit. Despite my decision to pursue this
    path, I still had doubts and the assumptions I made at the start reflected this
    skepticism. However, as I work through my final quarters, I am glad (and surprised!)
    by how the realities of my experience have diverged from those expectations.

    and math classes are a majority but each course offers a different perspective
    on core topics while equipping us with a myriad of tools. There’s also significantly
    more diversity in the field, ranging from classes on statistical fairness definitions
    to bioinformatics. I also found niches I especially enjoyed in healthcare, data
    ethics, and privacy. This helped widen my perspectives on the roles and industries
    I could enter as a data scientist early on.

    and it’s just more fun! Nevertheless, I initially gave into the stereotype and
    pictured myself doing my data science homework hunched over a laptop for the better
    part of my day, so I was surprised by how much group work there was. Nearly all
    my programming and math classes encourage us to work with at least one other person.
    Meeting and working with people I didn’t know pushed me outside my comfort zone
    and refined my teamwork and communication skills. Even in professional settings
    when my work was independent, I found that working with other interns made me
    a better data scientist. Although we each had similar foundational skills, leaning
    on one another to utilize our different strengths and areas of focus allowed us
    to be better as a whole.

- en: To be fair, I didn’t know much about data science or how machine learning (ML)
    was defined when I started my journey. Still, coming into the HDSI program, I
    thought data science was synonymous with ML. I imagined that most of my classes
    and work would be creating predictive models and delving into neural networks.
    Instead, the bulk of courses and work in data science focuses on data cleaning,
    data expiration, and visualization, with the ML analysis taking less time than
    you’d expect at the end… at least for now.‍

- en: This concern originated during my first natural language processing class where
    my professor showed how quickly GPT-3 could write code. It was daunting as an
    entry-level data scientist — how was I supposed to compete with models that could
    correctly write SQL queries faster than I could read them? However, this exercise
    was meant to illustrate that our roles as technologists weren’t just learning
    to use tools and understand the inherent processes that allow them to function.
    Large language models still can’t do your homework correctly, but eventually (and
    inevitably) they will improve, and when they do, I’m optimistic that they’ll be
    more of an aid rather than a detriment to data scientists. Unlike data scientists,
    LLMs aren’t problem solvers. They can’t generate original ideas, use creativity
    to navigate ambiguous problems, or effectively communicate with different audiences.
    This may change in the future but through my education and professional experiences,
    I am confident that I can still make a positive impact in the field.

    that comes with reality. I learned that the breadth and depth of data science
    were ideal for doing a bit of everything: to research, to program, to analyze,
    and to tell stories. With that, I’m confident in my decision to pursue data science
    and excited to see what the next phase of my career brings.'
