    has resulted in incredible new tools and technologies, it’s not entirely clear
    how we (i.e. professionals, entrepreneurs, and business operators) can use these
    innovations to drive value in business.

- en: In this article, I provide a non-technical introduction to AI & Machine learning
    and share how they can fit into the way we do business. My goal here is to help
    those coming from non-AI/ML backgrounds make sense of these technologies by defining
    them in simple terms and sharing tips on how to start using them in practice.

    something like the Terminator. But let’s take a step back and ask the basic question,
    “*What is AI?*”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**AI** is short for ***artificial intelligence —*** which may not tell us much
    because one of these words is problematic.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first word, ***artificial****,* is not the issue. It simply means something
    **made by humans**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, the second word, ***intelligence***, is not well defined (even among
    AI researchers [1]). Nevertheless, a definition I like to use, and one that is
    most relevant in a business context, is ***intelligence*** = **the ability to
    solve problems and make decisions**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    **a computer’s ability to solve problems and make decisions**.

    or inside watching that new Netflix series. If you look out the window and see
    the scene in the image below, you may decide to stay in. That’s because the dark,
    cloudy sky is a good indicator that the weather won’t be great today.

    down but then peaks in November. If asked, “*What caused the peak?*” we might
    reasonably say that it’s because of Black Friday, one of the biggest retail days
    of the entire year.

    the position of the blue texter, do we really believe the other person is fine?
    Based on their word choice, probably not.

    the situation, can you help me understand better?*” Or “*I care about how you
    feel and want to make sure we both agree with the final decision.*”

    a problem or make a decision. While each was very different from the others, there
    was one thing they all had in common — they **required knowledge of how the world
    works**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    people shop a lot in November, and people don’t always admit it when upset. We
    know these things via our **models** of the world.

    For example, when we saw the dark clouds, that information was processed by our
    mental model of how weather works and allowed us to predict that it will rain
    later.

    (e.g. dark clouds) and turn them into outputs (e.g. rain). However, for situations

    idea. **Machine learning (ML)** is **a computer’s ability to learn by example**
    [3].
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The way it works is instead of explicitly telling a computer how to map inputs
    to outputs. The computer can learn this relationship by seeing many examples.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a powerful technique because it **allows us to develop models even if
    we lack a theoretical understanding** of the underlying thing, which is helpful
    in many contexts, such as sales, marketing, finance, weather, consumer behavior,
    and beyond.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Machine learning can be broken down into 2 steps. In the first step, we pass
    input-output pairs (i.e., predictors and targets) into an ML algorithm to obtain
    an ML model. Then, with a model in hand, we can pass new data into it to generate
    a prediction. This is illustrated in the image below.

    and defined it as a computer’s ability to solve problems and make decisions. Next,
    we introduced **models**, which are a critical part of intelligence and allow
    us to make predictions about the real world. Finally, we broke down **machine
    learning**, a way we can develop data-driven models of the world.

    value in a business context. Here, I will share an illustrative example of what
    AI looks like in practice to (hopefully) spark ideas of how you can start using
    AI in your work.

    application and decides whether to grant or deny the loan.

    it a day. Instead, the application passes through several business and IT processes
    before any machine learning (i.e. the credit risk model) is involved.

    — *it’s not easy.* To make matters worse, many fall into a common trap that makes
    the process much **harder than it needs to be** — *they start with the technology
    rather than the problem*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My old VP of Data Science would always say, “*When you have a hammer, everything
    looks like a nail.*” This captures a bias we (i.e. humans) have when it comes
    to building AI solutions. Namely, we are drawn toward **a technology-first rather
    than a problem-first approach**.

    a low probability of success (especially if you are not an expert). **Second**,
    there are way too many technologies to choose from.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A (much) better way is to **start with the problem** because in business, **solving
    problems = generating value**. And since we don’t get bonus points for using AI
    to solve our problems, we should seek the cheapest, quickest to implement, and
    most reliable solutions.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As we saw with the credit decision example, practical AI solutions can be more
    sophisticated than we might think. The (counterintuitive) secret to sophisticationis
    that it is the **result of many small and simple steps over a long period of time**.
    In other words, the secret to sophistication is iteration.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    fast, and easy approach** where each of these words is significant.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Simple —** You want to start simply because **sophistication is costly and
    fragile** (there are many more ways it can fail than succeed). This means forgoing
    an AI solution if a simpler one is available.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Fast —** Next, you want to prioritize fast solutions because (again) **the
    secret to sophistication is iteration**. If it takes you 6 months to build your
    first solution, you won’t be able to iterate fast enough to develop something
    significant (not to mention your solution might be obsolete at the current pace
    of innovation).'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Easy —** Finally, you want it to be easy. In other words, **don’t make it
    hard for people to use the solution**. This is for two main reasons. One, if no
    one uses it, you miss out on important feedback. And two, if it’s hard, that’s
    probably a sign that it doesn’t fit into your existing business process.'

    on AI and how to start using it in practice. It’s important to remember that AI
    (in practice) is often a collection of systems and technologies working in concert
    to solve a real-world problem. Two key elements in developing these solutions
    are a **problem-first approach** and **iteration**.
