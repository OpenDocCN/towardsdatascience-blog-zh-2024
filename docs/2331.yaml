- en: Decisions fuel business; without them, progress grinds to a halt. The difference
    between success and failure often boils down to the choices we make. In the realm
    of data science, decision-making takes centre stage, as algorithms sift through
    data to provide insights that drive action.

    in algorithms or the need for varied perspectives — mirror those encountered by
    businesses, governments, and organizations at large. Given how crucial decision-making
    is to business success, it’s surprising how little is borrowed from the field
    of data science.

    are likely to financially outperform other companies by 21% and 33% respectively

    that a diverse team is able to make more effective decisions than a less diverse
    one?
