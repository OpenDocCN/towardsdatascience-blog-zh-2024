- en: After hours of waiting in virtual queues, battling crashed servers, and frantically
    refreshing pages, like millions of other disappointed Swifties, I was left wondering
    how a tour could be so insanely popular that even getting the chance to buy a
    ticket felt like winning the lottery.

- en: But this struggle to secure tickets wasn’t just a testament to Swift’s popularity
    — it was a harbinger of the Eras Tour’s mind-boggling success. It didn’t just
    break records; it obliterated them. The total tour gross sit somewhere around
    an estimated $2.165 billion, leaving previous record-holders — Elton John’s multi-year
    Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour that earned $939 million — in the dust.

- en: We live in an age of superlatives. Every day, we’re bombarded with headlines
    proclaiming the “biggest,” “fastest,” or “most successful” achievements in various
    fields. But how do we truly measure the exceptionality of these feats? When Taylor
    Swift’s Eras Tour shattered box office records or Lionel Messi bagged 106 goal
    contributions in one year, **how surprised should we really be**?
