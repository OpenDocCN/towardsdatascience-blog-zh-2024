    with the field is a major challenge. We see new models, cutting-edge research,
    and LLM-based apps proliferate on a daily basis, and as a result, many practitioners
    are understandably concerned about falling behind or not using the latest and
    shiniest tools.

    dominating conversations around LLMs, or are curious about the emerging themes
    machine learning professionals are exploring, we’re here to help. In this week’s
    Variable, we’re highlighting standout articles that dig deep into the current
    state of LLMs, both in terms of their underlying capabilities and practical real-world
    applications. Let’s dive in!

    presents a detailed introduction to the challenges LLMs face in decision-making
    tasks, and outlines a promising approach that combines the power of the GPT-4o
    model with Language Agent Tree Search (LATS), “a dynamic, tree-based search methodology”
    that can enhance the model’s reasoning abilities.'

    recent deep dive also tackles the problem of evaluating LLMs, but from a different,
    more theoretical direction. It takes a close look at the different strategic behaviors
    that leading models (from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Meta) exhibit as they navigate
    the rules of classic board game Risk, discusses their shortcomings, and looks
    at the potential future of LLMs’ reasoning skills.'
