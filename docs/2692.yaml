- en: From my experience, people who work in data science have a wide diversity of
    backgrounds. I (like many of my fellow data scientists) didn’t start my career
    in data science right out of college. I started out working as a securities broker
    in the investment finance industry. I quickly discovered that the career path
    I originally chose was not a good fit and started a multi-year journey towards
    becoming a data scientist. In this article, I’m going to share 8 strategies I
    used in my successful transition to becoming a data scientist. Let’s get into
    it!

- en: Data science is a competitive industry and it can be difficult to get into,
    especially if you weren’t originally planning on it. It is crucial that you know
    that you really want to work in the field — if your journey will be anything like
    mine, it will take some significant time and effort to break into your first data
    science job. You need to be sure this is what you want so you stay focused and
    don’t lose motivation in your journey!
