    multiple choice, of course, is constructed to feel this way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But there is a rational approach we can take here, which is to recognise that
    each of these options have different *base rates*. This is to say, forgetting
    about what is and isn‚Äôt a malmsey for a moment, we can sense that there probably
    aren‚Äôt as many names for hangovers as there are for witch‚Äôs curses, and there
    are bound to be even more names for all the different fortified wines out there.

  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    wine would be a well reasoned guess. Based on my back-of-envelope estimates above,
    fortified wine would be x100 as likely to be correct as the mild hangover and
    x10 as likely as the witch‚Äôs curse.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    contingency tables from the Dobelli example. Because B is uninformative, we give
    50:50 odds for the word malmsey matching any other word or concept. This is overkill
    and hardly necessary once we recognise that we can simply scale our belief in
    the answer with the base rates, but it‚Äôs there to show the Bayesian framework
