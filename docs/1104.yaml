- en: In Australia, students can afford tertiary education through a government loan
    known as the Higher Education Loan Program (HELP). To ensure the value of the
    loan is not devalued, they are indexed annually based on the Consumer Price Index.
    Candidates begin to repay the loan when their post-tax income exceeds ~$51k and
    has a stepped repayment rate that reaches a maximum of 10% when earning above
    ~$151k. The most recent indexation rate was a record 7.1% and hadn’t been that
    high since the 1990s, causing a lot of people to become more aware of the creeping
    nature of how these student debts are maintained.

    and then later retraining with a Master's program during COVID. For most of my
    20s I wasn’t earning enough to make the compulsory contributions threshold, so
    in time the debt crept up. The addition of a Master's degree (~40k) then pushed
    the debt to a new level. Whilst now I’m taking steps to remove the debt and recover
    the non-productive deductions that are being made, you can imagine this is a burden

    This way we capture most of the graduate salaries around this point, but allow
    for much higher starting salaries that can be available in some sectors. Similarly,
    for debt, we’ve taken the current average student debt and applied a reasonably
    right-skewed distribution to capture the broad range of debts.

    across 10 years and assume this follows a normal distribution, as above. Similarly,
    we’ve taken a conservative, and positive view on salary growth by assuming an
    average annual increase of 3% following a log-normal distribution that enables
    graduates to climb faster because of promotions or new job opportunities.

- en: Let’s unpack, we’ve simulated three scenarios noted above. The reason we’ve
    simulated a 10% repayment rate, is because this is what New Zealand do for student
    debt, starting from ~ NZD 25,000\. Some might say this is quite punitive, however,
    NZ does not charge interest or apply indexation unless graduates leave the country
    to work. I thought this would be a reasonable scenario to scope out. The above
    visualization shows the debt trajectory for each scenario for the first 9 students
    in our dataset — we’ve simulated 50,000 students in total.

- en: Index 4 is a great example of how salary and debt indexation are conditionally
    independent. For the first 14 years in the current state, no repayments were made
    against the debt. Secondly, it wasn’t until year 15 that the graduate had a post-tax
    salary that was above the ~51,000 threshold for compulsory payments, but the debt
    grew nearly 22,000 in that period, and within the 20-year horizon doesn’t clear
    the debt.

    as the indexation will continue to outpace the current rate of repayment each
    year. Which is the better outcome, a graduate that pays off their student debt
    or has this burden for the rest of their professional lives, scraping increments
    from their salary at values less than the effect of indexation?

    20 years given the three scenarios above, moving the indexation point, and increasing
    the repayment rate. We then used this data to assess any difference in mean years
    to debt clearance and noted that **changing the indexation point will have not
    a tangible effect**, and **increasing the repayment rate to a flat 10% represents
    a viable option to enable graduates to pay off their debt faster**. We can express
    these statements concerning our DAG, by increasing repayments we observed a faster
    decrease in debt levels. Also, the impact of indexation is independent of salary,
    and as such any attempt to mitigate its impact based on income levels ignores
    the relationship below.
