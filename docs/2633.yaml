    subtasks is helpful for any kind of problem solving. This is also true for IT
    systems that digitalize our business processes. Architects therefore followed
    the tried and tested path of „divide and conquer“ in IT and divided our systems
    into smaller applications/services that fulfil specific tasks for different business
    areas.

    applications/services representing the digitalized business processes also grew
    overly complex. So we’re constantly trying to keep order and structure so that
    the whole mess doesn’t implode and stop working altogether — that’s actually *Enterprise
    Architecture*, if you ever wondered what those guys in the ivory tower are trying
    to achieve with their architecture component diagrams.
