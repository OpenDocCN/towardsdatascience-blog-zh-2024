- en: Modern AI models, especially those in deep learning, are highly complex and
    often called “black boxes” because their intricate algorithms are difficult to
    comprehend, even for the developers. This lack of transparency conflicts with
    the need for accountability in areas where decisions must be explainable and verifiable.
    Additionally, laws such as the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
    now mandate greater clarity in automated systems, legally requiring that individuals…
