    publication experience and academic credentials to serve as reviewers, ***machine
    learning and data science might be an exception****.* A significant driver of
    the widespread adoption and use of data science has been *open-source projects
    and repositories*. Many influential contributors to open-source data science are
    not always published researchers but possess deep knowledge of the field through
    practice and experimentation. Additionally, formal academic degrees in machine
    learning have only existed for a few years, and many current researchers come
    from diverse backgrounds. I, for example, have a background in Mechanical Engineering.

    Instead, I mostly did it as an academic *obligation* when my advisor asked me
    to do so. Furthermore, I lacked confidence in my ability to critique others’ work,
    given that I only had few publications under my belt.

    As a student, reading papers was part of the job. In industry, however, I only
    read the most popular papers. To stay current with the latest research, fulfill
    my academic responsibilities, and build a stronger research profile, I began emailing
    editors of various journals to express my interest in becoming a reviewer. Although
    I received responses from almost *all* the journals, only 2–3 assigned me papers
    initially. Over time, I started receiving review requests from journals I hadn’t

- en: Peer review is a crucial tool that, *ideally*, ensures high-quality scientific
    work. It is a process used to evaluate the quality, validity, and relevance of
    research or scholarly work *before* it is published or accepted for presentation.
    This evaluation is performed by expert peers in the relevant domain. The peer
    review process helps ensure that published research is of high quality and contributes
    meaningfully to the field, maintaining academic standards and credibility.

    2024**](https://cvpr.thecvf.com/Conferences/2024/News/Oral_Papers)**.** Even though
    editorial boards of popular journals/conferences may include a few hundred members,
    they are far out numbered by the number of submissions. Additionally, most publications
    have at least 2 rounds of reviews, effectively doubling the number of reviews
    required.'

    connections.'
