- en: Not every Data Scientist will have to decide between Python or R. I constantly
    see discussions around that matter, some of them annoying, some quite funny. But
    the truth is that there are and there will be many Data Scientists who can use
    both languages because they won’t need to deploy anything or bring a whole application
    online. They are just required to analyze some data and create a straightforward
    executive presentation, in the good old PowerPoint, if you will.

    and the packages are pretty well built. One of those in my treasure box is the
