- en: 2023 will forever be remembered as the year of Generative AI. In this digital
    age, you’d be hard-pressed to find someone with internet access who hasn’t heard
    of ChatGPT. If you have been around long enough to witness a technology cycle
    or two, you know that we are entering quite a transformative one. According to
    a [McKinsey survey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai-in-2022-and-a-half-decade-in-review),
    AI adoption has doubled since 2017\. While the recent developments will undoubtedly
    accelerate the adoption further, I tend to believe that the results we will see
    in 2024 will remain relatively small as most companies are still trying to figure
    out how to align data strategy with business objectives while also navigating
    the increasing regulatory scrutiny. As far as the data industry is concerned,
    AI adoption will drive further data adoption by making data and the data infrastructure
    more accessible to broader users within the organization, making the case for
    more AI projects. Secure democratization of the data will be a big topic; we will
    see more practical implementations of the data mesh and more investment toward
    security, privacy, and observability.

    where we are likely to see continued investments from enterprises and the enthusiasm

- en: In traditional data engineering, a data pipeline is the process by which data
    is moved from source to destination, typically to make it accessible to the business
    through BI for reporting and analytics. The ML pipeline is similar to the traditional
    data pipeline in the sense that it is also a process of data movement; however,
    its primary purpose is to enable the process of developing and deploying machine
    learning models, and in that sense, unlike the data pipeline, the ML pipeline
    is not a “straight line” — more on the differences between data and ML pipelines

    said, as both Data & AI get more regulated, the scrutiny around personal data
    protection policies will increase. Great summary of what to expect as far as AI
    regulation goes for the next 12 months [here](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/01/08/1086294/four-lessons-from-2023-that-tell-us-where-ai-regulation-is-going/).

- en: Since it was first introduced by its creator Zhamak in 2019, the data mesh has
    been subject to numerous debates and a fair share of skepticism. Four years later,
    several implementations and variations emerged where companies embraced the principles
    of the concept and applied them to their architecture. Decentralization, domain-oriented
    design, IaaS, data as a product, and end-to-end federated governance are all great
    principles organizations should embrace to create and foster a silo-free, democratized
    data environment. However, moving from a traditional monolithic structure to a
    full data mesh is not easy and requires significant cultural and organizational
    change. This is why a gradual adoption that allows to slowly introduce the concept
    and prove its value while aligning existing and future technology and business
    considerations is what we have seen most work over the last couple of years.

    and organizational shift, not a technology solution. I think the BYODM approach

    in every modern organization’s data strategy. If you are new to the concept, I
    recommend you start [here](https://medium.com/the-observatory-by-sifflet/data-quality-monitoring-is-dead-say-hello-to-full-data-stack-observability-f73cac27ea52)
    or [here](https://www.siffletdata.com/blog/five-signs-you-need-a-data-observability-tool).
    There is no denying that AI will also reshape the Data Observability space. Adopting
    AI agents and using NLP will increase the level of automation and inclusivity
    of the platform solutions, which in turn will propel the adoption. The concept
    of Data Observability, as we know it, will evolve to capture the potential of
    AI in observability and cover more AI use cases.

    what will become Data & AI Observability. If you look at data science as a data
    consumption use case, monitoring the data that goes into model training is already
    covered under most frameworks. The future of Data & AI Observability will evolve
    to include insights into ML model’s behavior, output, and performance. Like how
    data pipelines are covered today, Data Observability platforms will include actionable
    insights on ML pipelines to allow for effective anomaly detection, root cause
    analysis, and incident management and bring reliability and efficiency to ML product
    deployment.

- en: 2024 is a leap year, which means we have 366 opportunities to do more and create
    innovation with data. Although 2023 will forever be remembered as the year of
    Gen AI, 2024 is when we will start seeing organizations working toward Data &
    AI maturity. But to do AI right, a well-thought-out data strategy is instrumental.
    The Modern Data Stack is an ever-evolving space, and in 2024, we will see more
    innovation brought by and catalyzed by the growing adoption of AI. As companies
    experiment more with AI in 2024, governance and observability will take center
    stage to ensure smooth and efficient deployments.
