    friend John, who was nice enough to provide us with his chats with five of the
    closest people in his life. We used just the metadata, such as who sent messages
    at what time, to visualize when John met his girlfriend, when he had fights with
    one of his best friends and which family members he should write to more often.

    actual messages. Therefore, we will use the chat between John and Maria to identify
    the topics they discuss. And of course, we will not go through the messages one
    by one and classify them — no, we will use the Python library BERTopic to extract
    the topics that the chats revolve around.

- en: BERTopic is a topic modeling technique introduced by Maarten Grootendorst that
    uses transformer-based embeddings, specifically BERT embeddings, to generate coherent
    and interpretable topics from large collections of documents. It was designed
    to overcome the limitations of traditional topic modeling approaches like LDA
    (Latent Dirichlet Allocation), which often struggle to handle short…
