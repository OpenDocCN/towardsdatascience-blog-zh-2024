    missed the previous articles, definitely go back to read them. They lay the groundwork
    for what we’re about to dive into today.

    by building a [simple model to predict the daily revenue of an ice cream](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/deep-learning-illustrated-part-2-how-does-a-neural-network-learn-481f70c1b474)
    shop. We found that neural networks can handle complex problems by harnessing
    the combined power of several neurons. This allows them to uncover patterns in
    data that might otherwise be hard to recognize. We also learned that neural networks
    primarily solve two types of problems: Regression or Classification.'

    diverse problems by modifying the structure. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
    are specialized models designed for image recognition tasks. However, they rely
    on the same fundamental principles as the models we have encountered thus far
    (plus a few more steps). Today, we will explore the inner workings of a CNN and
    understand exactly what is…
