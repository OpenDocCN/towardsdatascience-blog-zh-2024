- en: As a data scientist, I have spent a large part of my career designing and building
    customer base management (CBM) systems. These are systems that monitor and predict
    anything from customer churn and customer price elasticity to recommending the
    products customers are most likely to buy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I have witnessed how CBM systems have been successfully adopted by organizations,
    and enabled them to execute their strategy through effective pricing, improved
    retention and more targeted sales activities. Combining forecasting with the visual
    effect of dashboards, CBM systems can provide an effective way for managers to
    communicate with executive leadership. This enhances decision-making and helps
    leaders better understand the consequences of their actions, particularly regarding
    the customer base and projected future revenues from that base.

    of churn, a visual understanding of the data, and furthermore it allows them to
    communicate any findings to the leadership and other stakeholders. Below we detail
    each of these components in depth.

- en: ELT — Getting the Data
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Extract-Load-Transform, ELT for short, is the first and most critical part of
    a customer base management system. This is the component that feeds the system
    with data, and is often the first component to be built when creating a CBM system.
    To get started, you will typically interact with some kind of data platform where
    most of the rudimentary data manipulation has already been performed (in this
    case you are technically only required to do the “load” and “transform”), but
    sometimes you need get directly from source systems as well and “extract” the
    data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Irrespective of where the data comes from, it needs to be loaded into your system
    and transformed into a format that is easy to input into the machine learning
    models you are using. You will also likely need to transform the data into formats
    that makes it easier to make dashboards from the data. For some dashboards it
    might also be necessary to pre-aggregate a lot of data in smaller tables to improve
    query and plotting performance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is easy to see that if there are mistakes in the ELT process, or if there
    are errors in the incoming data, this has the potential to severely affect the
    CBM system. Since everything in the system is based on this incoming data, extra
    care needs to be taken to ensure accuracy and alignment with business rules.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I have seen multiple times where the ELT process has failed and led to mistakes
    in the churn predictions and dashboard. One way to monitor the consistency of
    the data coming into the system is to keep records of the distribution of each
    variable and track that distribution over time. In case of radical changes to
    the distribution you can then quickly check whether something is going wrong with
    the logic in the ELT process or if the problem is arising from data issues further
    upstream.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second critical component in understanding your customer base is identifying
    who, when and why customers churn (for non-practitioners, “churn” refers to the
    point at which a customer stops using a product or service). A good churn prediction
    algorithm allows businesses to focus retention efforts where they matter most,
    and can help identify customers that are at an elevated risk of leaving.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Back in the mid-1990s, telcos, banks, insurance companies and utilities where
    some of the first to start using churn modelling on their customer base, and developing
    basic churn models is relatively straightforward.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first task at hand is to decide the definition of churn. In many cases this
    is very straightforward, for example when a customer cancels a telco contract.
    However, in other industries, such as e-commerce, one needs to use some judgement
    when deciding on the definition of churn. For example, one could define a customer
    as having churned if that customer had not had a repeat shop 200 days after their
    last shop.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After churn has been defined, we need to select and outcome period for the model,
    that is a time frame within which we want to observe churn. For example, if we
    want to create a churn model with outcome period of 10 weeks, that would gives
    a a model that would predict the likelihood that a customer would churn at any
    point between the time of scoring and the next 10 weeks. Alternatively, we could
    have an outcome period of a year, which would give us a model that predicted churn
    at any time within the next year.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After the outcome period and churn definition has been decided, analysts need
    to transform the data into a format which makes it easy for the machine learning
    models to train on and also later for inference.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After the models are trained and predictions are being run on the active customer
    base, there are multiple different use cases. We can for example use the churn
    scores to identify customers at high risk of leaving and target them with specific
    retention campaigns or pricing promotions. We can also create differentiated marketing
    material to different groups of customers based on their churn score. Or we can
    use the churn score together with the products the customer has to develop customer
    lifetime value models, which in turn can be used to prioritize various customer
    activities. It is clear that proper churn models can give a company a strategic
    advantage in how it manages it customer base compared to competitors who neglect
    this basic component of CBM.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Dashboards, BI, and analytics used to be all the rage back in the 2000s and
    early 2010s, before the maturity of machine learning algorithms shifted our focus
    toward prediction over descriptive and often backwards looking data. However,
    for a CBM tool, dashboards remain a critical component. They allow managers to
    communicate effectively with leadership, especially when used alongside advanced
    features like price optimization. Visualizing the potential impact of a specific
    pricing strategy, can be very powerful for decision-making.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As with any data science project, you may invest thousands of hours in building
    a system, but often, the dashboard is the main point of interaction for managers
    and executives. If the dashboard isn’t intuitive or doesn’t perform well, it can
    overshadow the value of everything else you’ve built.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, dashboards offer a way to perform visual sanity checks on data
    and can sometimes reveal untapped opportunities. Especially in the early phases
    after a system has been implemented, and perhaps before all control routines have
    been set into production, maintaining a visual check on all variables and model
    performance can act as a good safety net.

    get the maximum value out of a CBM system, more advanced components are needed.
    Below we discuss a few of the most important components, such as having churn
    models with multiple time horizons, adding price optimization, using simulation-based
    forecasting and adding competitor pricing data.

- en: Multiple Horizon Churn Models
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes it makes sense to look at churn from different perspectives, and one
    of those angles is the time horizon — or outcome period — you allow the model
    to have. For some business scenarios, it makes sense to have a model with a short
    outcome period, while for others it can make sense to have a model with a 1-year
    outcome period.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To better explain this concept, assume you build a churn model with 10-week
    outcome period. This model can then be used to give a prediction whether a given
    customer will churn within a 10-week period. However, assume now that you have
    isolated a specific event that you know causes churn and that you have a short
    window of perhaps 3 weeks to implement any preventative measure. In this case
    it makes sense to train a churn model with a 3-week horizon, conditional on the
    specific event you know causes churn. This way you can focus any retention activities
    on the customers most at risk of churning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This kind of differentiated approach allows for a more strategic allocation
    of resources, focusing on high-impact interventions where they’re needed most.
    By adapting the model’s time horizon to specific situations, companies can optimize
    their retention efforts, ultimately improving customer lifetime value and reducing
    unnecessary churn.

- en: Price is in many cases the final part of strategy execution, and the winners
    are the ones who can effectively translate a strategy into an effective price
    regime. This is exactly what a CBM system with prize optimization allow companies
    to do. While the topic of price optimization easily warrants its own article,
    we try to briefly summarize the key ideas below.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first thing needed to get started is to get data on historic prices. Preferably
    different levels of price across time and other explanatory variables. This allows
    you to develop an estimate for price elasticity. Once that is in place, you can
    develop expected values for churn at various price points and use that to forecast
    expected values for revenue. Aggregating up from a customer level gives the expected
    value and expected churn on a product basis and you can find optimal prices per
    product. In more complex cases you can also have multiple cohorts per product
    that each have their optimal price points.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, assume a company has two different products, product A and product
    B. For product A, the company wishes to grow its user base and are only willing
    to accept a set amount of churn, while also being competitive in the market. However,
    for product B they are willing to accept a certain amount of churn in return for
    having an optimal price with respect to expected revenues. A CBM system allows
    for the roll out of such a strategy and gives the leadership a forecast for the
    future expected revenues of the strategy.

- en: Simulation-Based Forecasting
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Simulation based forecasting provides a more robust way generating forecast
    estimates rather than just doing point estimation based on expected values. By
    using methods like Monte Carlo simulation, we are able generate probability densities
    for outcomes, and thus provide decision makers with ranges for our predictions.
    This is more powerful than just point estimates because we are able to quantify
    the uncertainty.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'To understand how simulation based forecasting can be used, we can illustrate
    with an example. Suppose we have 10 customers with given churn probabilities,
    and that each of these customers have a yearly expected revenue. (In reality we
    typically have a multivariate churn function that predicts churn for each of the
    customers.) For simplicity, assume that if the customer churns we end up with
    0 revenue and if they don’t churn we keep all the revenue. We can use python to
    make this example concrete:'

    this doesn’t tell us anything about the variation we can expect to see. To get
    a deeper understanding of the range of possible outcomes we can expect, we turn
    to Monte Carlo simulation. Instead of taking the expected value of the churn rate
    and total revenue, we instead let the situation play out 10000 times (10000 is
    here chosen arbitrarily; the number should be chosen so as to achieve the desired
    granularity of the resulting distribution), and for each instance of the simulation
    customers either churn with probability `churn_rate` or they stay with probability
    `1- churn_rate`.

    and 13034 we started with. We now understand much more about the possible outcomes
    we can expect to see, and we can have an informed discussion about what levels
    of churn and revenue we we find acceptable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Continuing with the example above we could for example say that we would only
    be prepared to accept a 0.1 % chance of 8 or more churn events. Using individual
    customer price elasticities and simulation based forecasting, we could tweak the
    expected `churn_rates` for customers so that we could exactly achieve this outcome.
    This kind of customer base control is only achievable with an advanced CBM system.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the most important factors in pricing is the competitor price. How aggressive
    competitors are will to a large degree determine how flexible a company can be
    in its own pricing. This is especially true for commoditized businesses such as
    utilities or telcos where it’s hard for providers to differentiate. However, despite
    the importance of competitor pricing, many business choose not to integrate this
    data into their own price optimization algorithms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reasons for not including competitor pricing in price algorithms are varied.
    Some companies claim that it’s too difficult and time consuming to collect the
    data, and even if they started now, they still wouldn’t have all the history they
    need to train all the price elasticity models. Others say the prices of competitor
    products are not directly comparable to their own and that collecting them would
    be difficult. Finally, most companies also claim that they have price managers
    who manually monitor the market and when competitors make moves, they can adjust
    their own prices in response, so they don’t need to have this data in their algorithms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first argument can increasingly be mitigated by good web scraping and other
    intelligence gathering methods. If that is not enough, there are also sometimes
    agencies that can provide historic market data on prices for various industries
    and sectors. Regarding the second argument about not having comparable products,
    one can also use machine learning techniques to tease out the actual cost of individual
    product components. Another method is also to use different user personas that
    can be used to estimate the total monthly costs of a specific set of products
    or product.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ultimately, not including competitor prices leaves the pricing algorithms and
    optimization engines at a disadvantage. In industries where price calculators
    and comparison websites make it increasingly easy for customers to get a grasp
    of the market, companies run a risk of being out-competed on price by more advanced
    competitors.
