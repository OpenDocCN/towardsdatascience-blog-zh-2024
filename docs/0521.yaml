    later *discover* the moons of Jupyter. He anchors LLMs to the far end of the invention-discovery
    spectrum by arguing that “*[as opposed to] a 787 [which] is an engineered object,
    LLMs are much more like discoveries. We are constantly being surprised by their
    capabilities*”.

    are already driving excitingly innovative use cases everywhere. They are being
    wrapped in every shape and form and shipped to users as personalized customer
    service chatbots, writing assistants, and even embedded in new features at longstanding
    and widely used tools such as Adobe Photoshop. So it’s real technology. They are
    engineered tools — *inventions already* — right?

    comment¹ and start to look at each release of a new GPT by OpenAI or a new state-of-the-art
    open-source model by Meta solely as the outcome of…
