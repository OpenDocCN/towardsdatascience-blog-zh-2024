- en: At its core, **a digital twin is a virtual model of a physical entity** — a
    machine, a building, or even a planet! This type of virtual replica is becoming
    a reality thanks to advancements in compute capacity in recent years.

- en: Let’s imagine we had a twin, but instead of being an actual person, **this twin
    is a digital version of ourselves**. This digital twin would act just like us
    but exist on a computer. It could display real-time information about our body,
    such as stress levels or blood pressure, and even predict which symptoms we might
    develop in the future.

- en: While the human body might be tricky to imagine, let’s look at a more practical
    example. If we had a digital twin of our car, we could track how the engine is
    running, monitoring brake wear for example, or even get suggestions on when to
    take it in for maintenance. **A car’s digital twins could achieve this by**…
