- en: Since the release of ChatGPT has sparked developers’ interest in building applications
    with Large Language Models (LLMs), proprietary closed source foundation models,
    especially by OpenAI, have been dominating the market. OpenAI’s foundation model,
    gpt-3.5-turbo, which powers ChatGPT, is often the default LLM in programming tutorials.
    A survey conducted by a16z [1] in 2023 among 70 enterprise AI leaders showed that
    roughly 80% of enterprise market share was closed source — with the majority going
    to OpenAI.

- en: However, smaller open source models have been gaining popularity and could soon
    replace larger closed source ones. Mainly because the capabilities of open source
    LLMs are catching up. The main advantage of closed source models, performance,
    is now quickly diminishing. Additionally, the aforementioned survey respondents
    listed other factors, such as data security, customizability, and cost, which
    are making open source LLMs a more attractive alternative to closed source LLMs
    in enterprises. Some enterprise AI decision…
