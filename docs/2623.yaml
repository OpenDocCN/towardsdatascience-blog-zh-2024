    into a highly cross-functional job, as you need to **explain your data insights
    and sell your ideas** to your stakeholders to drive real business impacts. Therefore,
    to be a successful data scientist, presentation is an essential skill —many times
    using old-school PowerPoint or Google Slides. However, it is a skill that is usually
    missing from entry-level data scientists and analysts who focus heavily on technical
    skills.

    effective from numerous presentations I had to give during my seven years as a
    data scientist. I will also walk you through slide examples, which I created using
    fake data for illustration purposes. Hopefully, this will help you improve your
    presentation skills and advance your data career.
