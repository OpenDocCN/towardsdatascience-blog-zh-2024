    covering this, but in short, survival analysis is a statistical technique used
    to analyse time-to-event data, typically in the context of biomedical or observational
    studies. It focuses on estimating and modelling the time until an event of interest
    occurs, such as death, failure, or another specific outcome, providing insights

    on the event occurrence.

    probability of another earthquake happening within ten hours is approximately
    35% for cluster 0, 60% for cluster 1, and 48% for cluster 2\. This shows that

    such as **HDBSCAN** for spatial clustering and the **Kaplan-Meier** estimator
    for survival analysis, we gained valuable insights into the **regional variations
    in time between earthquakes**, which was translated into probability curves that
    can be useful for risk assessment and preparedness in earthquake-prone regions.
