- en: SQL is probably the most fundamental technical skill every data analyst and
    data scientist should master. It’s usually part of the interview process, and
    we spend significant time coding in SQL at work to collect data. Without it, there
    is no analysis or machine learning models. However, writing a functional query
    is different from writing a good query.

- en: At my recent job, we have over 1,000 queries scheduled on Airflow daily by our
    data scientists. I observed our Snowflake credits increased by 50% in just one
    year. When I volunteered to examine the top 10 credit usage queries, I soon realized
    there were numerous optimization opportunities, some quite simple. This article
    highlights six simple yet effective tips that helped me reduce SQL query running
    time by 50 hours daily. Some of them are extremely simple to apply, but remember,
    20% effort in SQL optimization leads to 80% of performance improvements.

    If you are a fellow data analyst or data scientist who writes SQL daily but wants
    to improve your queries (and make your data engineer friends happy), this is for
    you!
