    don’t make it into production, and of those that do, many fail to deliver on their
    promise.

    stats are hard to collect (and interpret), and some of the organizations circulating
    them have a stake in convincing practitioners that *their* solution is the key
    to all the AI-integration challenges they’re facing. Still, it’s hard to dismiss
    so many voices—from many different corners of our community—who acknowledge that
    reaping the benefits of this emerging technology is harder than it might seem
    at first.

    and making the most of AI-powered products and workflows. There’s never going
    to be a one-size-fits-all solution to the problem of integrating promising-yet-complex
    tools into a business, but we think that exploring these articles can frame the
    conversation in more useful and pragmatic terms. Let’s get to it.

    presents a detailed, hands-on introduction to a cutting-edge approach that builds
    on recent work on contextual retrieval and makes it possible to include not just
    textual data in your RAG pipelines, but visual media as well. From receipts to
    charts and tables, ML workflows can now become more robust with the use of richer,
    multimodal data.'
