- en: Have you ever asked a generative AI app, like ChatGPT, a question and found
    the answer incomplete, outdated, or just plain wrong? What if there was a way
    to fix this and make AI more accurate? There is! It’s called Retrieval Augmented
    Generation or just RAG. A novel concept introduced by Lewis et al in their seminal
    paper [*Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401)
    , RAG has swiftly emerged as a cornerstone, enhancing reliability and trustworthiness
    in the outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs have been shown to store
    factual knowledge in their parameters, also referred to as **parametric memory**
    and this knowledge is rooted in the data the LLM has been trained on. RAG enhances
    the knowledge of the LLMs by giving them access to an external information store,
    or a **knowledge base**. This knowledge base is also referred to as **non-parametric
    memory** (because it is not stored in model parameters). In 2024, [RAG is one
    of the most widely used techniques in generative AI applications](https://intelliarts.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-language-models/#:~:text=As%20evidence%2C%20Databricks%20reports%20that,RAG%20seems%20more%20than%20beneficial.).
