    to various reasons, such as sensor maintenance or transmission failure.

- en: Missing data is usually solved by data imputation strategies, such as replacing
    the missing value with a central statistic. For time series, the imputation process
    is more challenging because the observations are ordered. Besides that, it may
    be useful to choose a strategy that considers the mechanism that causes missing
    data.
