- en: The term MLOps, or Machine Learning Operations is a loaded term that comprises
    a complex of tasks, processes and infrastructure to set up, automate and monitor.
    An early 2015 paper by Google, before this term was even coined, describes this
    well, with ML code encompassing a small fraction of the overall real-world machine
    learning systems [1].

    of deploying a containerised workload or model to a serving infrastructure, taking
    into consideration automation, security and feedback loops.

    and what I will be showing is just one of them. While AWS, Terraform, GitLab,
    and Ansible used here are widely adopted in the real world, they have their popular
    alternatives. However, the methodologies and processes are agnostic and may also
    serve as insights on how to implement in other platforms you may use.
