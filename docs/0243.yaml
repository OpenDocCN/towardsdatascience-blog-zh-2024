    As a data scientist, you’re often asked to build forecast models, and you may
    believe that accuracy is always the golden standard. However, there’s a twist:
    the real magic lies not just in accuracy but in understanding the bigger picture
    and focusing on value and impact. Let’s uncover these important aspects together.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Regarding forecasts, we should first align on one thing: **our ultimate goal
    is about creating real value.** Real value can manifest as tangible financial
    benefits, such as cost reductions and revenue increases, or as time and resources
    that you free up from a forecast process. There are many pathways which start
    from demand forecast and end in value creation. Forecast accuracy is like our
    trusty compass that helps us navigate toward the goal, but it’s not the treasure
    we’re hunting for.'

    goal to set accurate sales targets? To lower inventory levels? What are the underlying
    concerns behind these forecast numbers?
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Create a simple business case to translate forecast accuracy metrics (bias,
    MAPE) into financial terms. If this task seems daunting, ask for help from your
    friends on the business side. Together, you will learn A LOT about the business
    and the value of your demand forecast.
  prefs:

    exercise. Is it reducing bias (particularly over-forecasting) to decrease inventory
    levels? Is it assessing the impact of discounts on various products categories
    (which might be better served by an elasticity model)? Or is it more about lowering
    MAPE to prevent the supply team from constantly reacting to unpredictable purchase
    orders in a crisis

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'In forecasts, you can add value in two areas: process and model. As data scientists,
    we may be hyper-focused on the model, however sometimes, a small tweak in the
    process can go a long way. **The process that produces the forecast can determine
    its quality**, usually in a negative way. Meanwhile, the **process that begins
    with the forecast is the pathway leading to value creation**. Without a good process,
    it would be hard for even the best model to create any value.'

- en: Learn about the “best practices” in forecasting. This can be tricky since different
    industries and business models have their own definitions of what “best practices”
    are. But some principles are universally valid. For instance, forecasts should
    be generated automatically on a regular basis; manual overrides should be rare
    and only for solid reasons; and forecasts ought to trigger clear decisions and
    actions like preparing production, adjusting inventory, or ramping up promotions.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Check out these “best practices” and see if you’ve covered all your bases. If
    yes, awesome! You’re ready for the next challenge. If not, dig a bit deeper. Ask
    yourself who or what is holding things back. What are the smallest changes that
    could improve the whole forecasting process? I’d really recommend grabbing a coffee
    with a key player in this area. You might be surprised at the impact you can have
    by swaying just one person in the forecast process.

    of the process is still tremendously valuable**.** **It allows you to focus on
    the key features that are most pertinent in the chain of decisions & actions.**

- en: For instance, if production plans need to be finalised two weeks in advance,
    there’s no need to focus on forecasts for the upcoming week. Likewise, if key
    decisions are made at the product family level, then it would be a waste of time
    to look at the accuracy at the individual product level. Let the (*unchangeable*)
    process details define the boundaries for your modelling, saving you from the
    futile task of boiling the ocean.

    process. Make sure each step includes these elements: the decision being made,
    the inputs for the decision, who’s making the decision, and the outcomes that
    follow. Remember, this isn’t an easy task and we’re not aiming for perfection.
    Gather as much info as you can and piece it together on paper.'

    all its circles and such) and try to pinpoint the most critical decisions in the
    entire process. Figure out what kind of forecast is essential for making solid
    decisions at these points: do you need a 6-month forecast at the product family
    level, or a weekly forecast for each specific product package variant? These are
    the crucial issues that your top-notch modelling skills and data science knowledge
    will tackle.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the modelling side, **explainability** should be a top priority, as it significantly
    enhances the adoption of the forecasts. Since our ultimate goal is value creation,
    forecasts must be used in business operations to generate tangible value.

    setting inventory targets to reduce stock levels. People often have the choice
    to trust or distrust the forecast in their daily tasks. (Ever been in a meeting
    where the forecast is dismissed because no one understands the numbers?) Without
    trust, there is no adoption of the forecast, and consequently, little value can
    be created.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the contrary, when the forecast numbers come with an intuitive explanation,
    people are more likely to trust and use them. As a result, the value of an accurate
    forecast can be realised in their daily tasks and decisions.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Think about the forecasting process and consider whether people want and need
    a better understanding of your forecast model. I’d say if the forecast is used
    for humans to make medium or long-term decisions (like budgeting, pricing, or
    capacity planning), explaining it is crucial to build trust in the data and prompt
    a decision.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You also need to grasp how decision-makers intuitively interpret or anticipate
    forecast numbers. Then, **tailor your explanation to speak their language**. This
    is the tricky part — you’ll have to rework your feature importance, Shap values,
    and regression coefficients into terms like “the impact of a 1% price increase.”
    Don’t hesitate to ask your business-savvy friend for help and test your explanation
    on them to see if it makes sense

- en: 5\. Simulate scenarios to facilitate decision-making
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Scenario simulation naturally extends from explainability. While an explainable
    model helps you understand forecasts based on anticipated key drivers (for example,
    a 10% price increase), scenario simulation enables you to explore and assess various
    alternatives of these anticipations or plans. You can evaluate the risks and benefits
    of each option. This approach is incredibly powerful in strategic decision-making.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, if you’re tasked with creating a forecast to determine next year’s promotion
    budget, it’s crucial to align with stakeholders on the key drivers you want to
    explore (such as discount levels, packaging format, timing, etc.) and the potential
    scenarios. Build your forecast around these key drivers to ensure not only accuracy,
    but also that the model’s explanations and scenarios “make sense”. This might
    mean anticipating an increase in demand when prices drop or as holidays approach.
    But of course, you need to figure out, together with the key stakeholders, about
    what “make sense” really means in your business.

    they want to be prepared for. Have them identify key factors and set the scene:
    a 10% inflation spike, supply disruption of a crucial raw material, a natural
    disaster, and so on. Ask them to rank these scenarios and factors in order of
    importance, so that you can prioritise.'

    You might need a few tries to tweak your models and get everything just right.

    this task. Don’t hesitate to ask for help. It’s a learning opportunity for both
    you and whoever assists you.

- en: Alright, I know this seems like a lot to take in. You might be thinking, “So,
    in addition to crunching data and training models, do I also need to delve into
    process analysis, come up with an explanatory model, and even build a simulation
    engine for forecasting?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    will help you pinpoint the key aspects for your forecasting model, figure out
    the best way to build them, and connect with the right people to enhance the value
    of your forecast. Sure, you’ll have to add a few extra tasks to your usual routine
    of data crunching and model tuning, but I promise it’ll be a rewarding experience
    — plus, you’ll get to make some business-savvy friends along the way!
