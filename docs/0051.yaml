- en: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are an incredible class of models. There are very few
    Machine Learning algorithms that give you an accurate measure of uncertainty for
    free while still being super flexible. The problem is, GPs are conceptually really
    difficult to understand. Most explanations use some complex algebra and probability,
    which is often not useful to get an intuition for how these models work.

- en: There also are many great guides that skip the maths and give you the intuition
    for how these models work, but when it comes to using GPs yourself, in the right
    context, my personal belief is that surface knowledge won’t cut it. This is why
    I wanted to walk through a bare-bones implementation, from scratch, so that you
    get a clearer picture of what’s going on under the hood of all the libraries that
    implement these models for you.

- en: I also link my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/TheodoreWolf/gps_numpy), where
    you’ll find the implementation of GPs using only NumPy. I’ve tried to abstract
    from the maths as much as possible, but obviously there is still some that are
    required…

    monthly CO2 atmospheric concentration over time, measured at the Mauna Loa observatory,
    a common dataset for GPs [1]. This is intentionally the same dataset that…
