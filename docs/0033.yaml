    it’s more suited for beginners in coding and data analysis. I think it's a dream
    come true for learners - however, what you got is a novice coding buddy. Likely
    because the codex is trained by less experienced [programmers and contractors](https://www.semafor.com/article/01/27/2023/openai-has-hired-an-army-of-contractors-to-make-basic-coding-obsolete)
    when OpenAI outsources its coders to train it. This makes it a useful tool for
    learning basics.
