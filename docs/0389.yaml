- en: '**GPT** is a well-known series of models whose last versions are currently
    dominating in various NLP tasks. The first GPT version was a significant milestone:
    being trained on enormous 120M parameters, this model demonstrated state-of-the-art
    performance on top benchmarks. Starting from this point, researchers tried to
    improve the base version.'

- en: In 2019, researchers from OpenAI officially released GPT-2\. It was 10 times
    bigger than GPT-1 which allowed it to improve performance even further. Apart
    from that, the authors conjectured in their work that **LLMs are multitask learners**
    meaning that they can learn to perform several tasks at the same time. This important
    statement made it possible to further develop LLMs in a much more efficient framework.

    by going through its main aspects and improvements over GPT-1 and understand a
    novel approach for building LLMs.
