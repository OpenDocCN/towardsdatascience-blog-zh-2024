- en: The blockchain is a technical implementation of a **distributed ledger**, most
    commonly associated with financial transactions. This is far from something that
    we might consider **beautiful**. Especially since the data stored on the blockchain
    mostly consists of complicated numbers, letters, and symbols associated with amounts
    of **value**, sender and recipient addresses (**wallets**), and metadata.

    computing](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/qubit-magic-creating-mythical-creatures-with-quantum-computing-49bea0fabf4),
    which, similar to the blockchain, also consists of complex numbers. I had wondered
    if it might be possible to combine the same visualization technique of using an
    AI and large language models, along with [prompt engineering](https://medium.com/itnext/prompt-engineering-the-magical-world-of-large-language-models-dde7d8d043ee),
    to generate images from a whole new source of data.
