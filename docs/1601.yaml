- en: Agents have recently been all over technical news sites. While people have big
    aspirations for what these programs can do, there has not been much discussion
    about the frameworks that should power these agents. From a high-level, an agent
    is simply a program, usually powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) that accomplishes
    an action. While anyone can prompt a LLM, the key distinguisher for agentic systems
    is their consistent performance in the face of ambiguous tasks.

    like Chain-of-Thought, reflection, and others have been shown to improve LLM performance,
    LLMs tend to improve radically when given proper feedback during a chat session.
    This can look like a scientist pointing out a flaw in the chat bot’s response,
    or a programmer copying in the compiler message when they try to run the LLM’s
    code.

    one might reasonably ask if we can find a way to have multiple LLMs giving each
    other feedback, thus…
