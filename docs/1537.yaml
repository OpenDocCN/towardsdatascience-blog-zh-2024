- en: Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting receives a lot of attention. Many
    articles and scientific papers write about the latest Deep Learning model and
    how it is much better than any ML or statistical model. This gives the impression
    that Deep Learning will solve all our problems for time series forecasting. In
    particular for new people in the field.

    more important and work better for time series forecasting.

    that have proven themselves in many ways. I will use the findings of the Makridakis
    M5 competitions and the Kaggle AI Report 2023 and compare them against my experience.

- en: The Makridakis competitions compare forecasting methods on real-world data sets.
    They show what works in practice. Since the start of the competitions almost 40
    years ago, their findings have changed. In the first three competitions, M1 to
    M3, statistical models dominated the field. In the M4 competition, ML models began
    to show their potential in the form…
