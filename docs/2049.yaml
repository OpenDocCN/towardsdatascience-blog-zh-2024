    week—that [TDS is always open to contributions from new authors](http://bit.ly/write-for-tds).
    And we mean it! Some of you might have seen this message and thought something
    along the lines of “great, I’d love to write an article!” but then wondered what
    kinds of posts would be a good fit, what topics our readers are interested in,
    and what types of experiences and skill sets are welcome.

- en: This week’s Variable edition highlights some of our best recent articles, so
    if you have no desire to become a TDS author, that’s totally fine! We hope you
    enjoy your reading as always. We’ve focused exclusively on posts by our most recent
    cohort of authors, however, in the hope that their work inspires you to give this
    a try, too.

- en: As you’ll see, TDS contributors come to us with a wide range of experience levels
    (from early learners to PhDs and industry veterans), interests, and writing styles.
    What unites them is great storytelling skills and a desire to share their knowledge
    with a broader community. We hope (and are fairly certain) you’ll enjoy our weekly
    lineup.

    **“**When we attribute human-like abilities to LLMs, we fall into an anthropomorphic
    bias by likening their capabilities to our own. But are we also showing an anthropocentric
    bias by failing to recognize the capabilities that LLMs consistently demonstrate?”
    In one of the most thought-provoking articles we’ve read recently, [Tarik Dzekman](https://medium.com/u/752038078741?source=post_page---user_mention--3263a1bdd7eb--------------------------------)
    tackles the question of LLMs’ capacity to understand language, looking at the
    topic through a philosophy- and psychology-informed lens.'

    we understand that feature engineering is a very crucial step in generating good
    results from the model. The same concept applies in NLP as well.” [Lakshmi Narayanan](https://medium.com/u/c68610e86b8?source=post_page---user_mention--3263a1bdd7eb--------------------------------)
    offers a thorough overview of text-vectorization approaches and weighs their respective

    incumbent on data scientists to gradually shift from traditional deep learning
    to generative AI techniques in order to revolutionize their role.” [Mary Ara](https://medium.com/u/41e7fd5de021?source=post_page---user_mention--3263a1bdd7eb--------------------------------)
    presents an end-to-end project walkthrough that demonstrates how to do precisely
    that—in this case, through the creation of a calorie-tracking app that leverages
    a cutting-edge multimodal model.'

    this scenario: we have an sklearn model currently deployed in production for a
    particular use case. Later on, we find that a deep learning model performs even
    better. If the sklearn model was deployed in its native format, transitioning
    to the deep learning model could be a hassle because the two model artifacts are
    very different.” [Mena Wang, PhD](https://medium.com/u/2b42227db6a9?source=post_page---user_mention--3263a1bdd7eb--------------------------------)

    nonlinear activation functions? There’s a traditional reasoning, and also a new
