- en: After transitioning out of quant finance, my first experience as a data scientist
    was in consulting. Most of the feedback I received in my early days at McKinsey
    was not related to my code or technical skills, but rather consisted of advice
    like “you need to tie your work to the higher-level priority of the company/organization”,
    “you should add more crisp insights” or “you need to be more of a thought partner”.

    a lot of this feedback initially felt like fuzzy consulting jargon to me and I
    would have rather had someone critique my code. Now being a manager myself and
    looking back, I realize that these seemingly disconnected points are all related
    to one thing — the mindset I was missing back when I was a junior IC focused on
    polishing my technical skillset.

    however, thinking that my job was only to perform a task well was a mistake in
    hindsight. Over the years since then, I’ve grown convinced that an ownership mentality
    is one of the key things that sets high performers apart from their peers.
