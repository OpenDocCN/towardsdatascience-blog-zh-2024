- en: Real-world data is mostly messy and requires careful preprocessing before using
    in any machine learning (ML) model. We almost always face the null values in our
    datasets, which could have been highly valuable for our analysis or modelling
    if observed. We refer it as the **missingness in the data**.

- en: There can be various reasons behind the missingness, such as the malfunction
    of a device, a non-mandatory field in the ERP system, or a non-applicable question
    in a survey for the participants. Depending on the reason, the nature of the missingness
    also varies. How we can understand this nature is explained in detail in [my previous
    article](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/addressing-missing-data-f6f7920bcc55).
    In this article, the focus is mostly on how to handle this missingness properly
    without causing bias or loss of critical insights by deletion or imputation.

- en: It is essential to understand the nature of the missingness (MCAR, MAR, MNAR)
    to decide on the correct handling methodology. Therefore, if you think you need
    more information on that, I suggest you to initially read my previous [article](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/addressing-missing-data-f6f7920bcc55).
