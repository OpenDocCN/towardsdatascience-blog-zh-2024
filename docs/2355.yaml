- en: In the span of just a few years, AI-powered tools have gone from (relatively)
    niche products targeting audiences with specialized skill sets to ones that are
    widely and rapidly adopted—sometimes by organizations that do not fully understand
    their tradeoffs and limitations.

    points. Individuals and teams alike are currently navigating the tricky terrain
    of an emerging technology that comes with many kinks that are yet to be ironed
    out.

    with clarity and pragmatism. From handling hallucinations to making the right
    product choices for specific use cases, they tackle some of AI’s biggest pain
    points head-on. They might not present perfect solutions for every possible scenario—in
    some cases, one just doesn’t exist (yet?)—but they can help you approach your
    own challenges with the right mindset.

    a growing understanding of the safety and privacy risks inherent to LLM-based
    products, particularly ones where sophisticated “jailbreaking” techniques can,
    with some persistence and patience, bypass whatever data-protection measures the
    developers had put in place. [Kenneth Leung](https://medium.com/u/dcd08e36f2d0?source=post_page---user_mention--10102dd4309d--------------------------------)

    the open-source ARTKIT framework to automatically evaluate LLM security vulnerabilities.'

    rise of AI agents has opened up new opportunities to automate and streamline tedious
    workflows, but also raises pressing questions about matching the right tool to
    the right task. [Aparna Dhinakaran](https://medium.com/u/f32f85889f3a?source=post_page---user_mention--10102dd4309d--------------------------------)’s
    detailed overview addresses one of the biggest dilemmas ML product managers currently
    face when picking an agent framework: “Do you go with the long-standing LangGraph,
    or the newer entrant LlamaIndex Workflows? Or do you go the traditional route
    and code the whole thing yourself?”'

    **“**Imagine an AI misreading an invoice amount as $100,000 instead of $1,000,
    leading to a 100x overpayment.” If an LLM-based chatbot hallucinates a bad cookie
    recipe, you end up with inedible treats. If it responds to a business query with
    the wrong information, you might find yourself making very costly mistakes. From
    relying on smaller models to leveraging grounding methods, [Tarik Dzekman](https://medium.com/u/752038078741?source=post_page---user_mention--10102dd4309d--------------------------------)
