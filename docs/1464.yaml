    and metal business. He wanted to know if it was possible to create something that
    would help him solve the problem of minimizing waste when cutting steel beams.
    Sounds like a problem for linear programming!

- en: When I started out, there was not a huge amount of beginners articles on how
    to use linear programming in R that made sense for somebody not that versed in
    math. Linear programming with R was also an area where ChatGPT did not shine in
    early 2023, so I found myself wishing for a guide.

    to someone.

    R, with a basic example. In [**part II**](https://medium.com/p/4fa9521ac3a7#8ceb-e636a4247639),
    I will teach you how to create a more advanced model. If there is enough demand,
    I might expand it to **Part III**, where I go into details on how to create a
    Shiny app actually using linear programming to optimize work.'

- en: Linear programming deals with finding the optimal solution of a linear function.
    Common examples are the knapsack problem (given a set of items with a value and
    a weight, figure out which items to put in the knapsack, so that you do not exceed
    the weight limit while maximing the value of the items you pick) and the travelling
    salesman problem (given a set…
