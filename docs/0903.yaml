    into my own journey — a gradual process of discovering my passion for data science.
    It took me quite a while to figure out my career path, but the journey was certainly
    worthwhile. I hope my story serves as inspiration to anyone out there who may
    be struggling to become a data scientist or doubting their own abilities.

    to the States all by myself. I didn’t know there was a difference between “meth”
    and “math”. It took me about a year to finally grasp the distinction. I wasn’t
    involved in making drugs; instead, I was a math tutor at [The Math Lab](https://www.ccsf.edu/ram-resources/math-lab)
    at City College of San Francisco (CCSF).

    United States, believing I can build a new life here. I was a bold and naive 18
    years old girl. I vividly remember the first few days in downtown San Francisco,
    where I couldn’t even manage to order a simple cup of coffee at Starbucks. I stumbled
    over my words, leaving the employee perplexed, and she responded in rapid English.
    Feeling overwhelmed, I resorted to a bow of thanks, a gesture from Korean culture,
    before hastily leaving the store.

    various subjects, including German, Swimming, Computer Science, Math, English
    and Statistics. Amidst this exploration, I found my passion. My childhood dream
    was to become a math teacher, driven by my love for Mathematics and children.
    As I pursued relevant courses, I found that taking Statistics was a game-changer.
    I fell in love with every aspect of it, which ultimately led me to pursue a major
    in Statistics when transferring.

    the admission to multiple universities, they were unfamiliar with prestigious
    institutions like UC Berkeley. Nonetheless, they were willing to support me financially,
    covering tuition and living expenses, proud in the knowledge that their daughter
    was embarking on a college education.

- en: As a junior majoring Statistics at UC Berkeley, I explored potential career
    paths. I joined both Statistics club and Actuarial club to gain insights. Initially,
    becoming an actuary seemed like a logical choice — I enjoyed solving math problems,
    passed a few actuarial exams, and completed an actuarial internship. However,
    I encountered difficulties in securing a full-time actuarial position. Despite
    this setback, I now see it as a learning experience. Looking back, I realize that
    my current job brings me more satisfaction than I would have found in an actuarial
    role.

    and a merchandise planner position at an e-commerce company. I chose to become
    a merchandise planner and had the opportunity to collaborate with data scientists
    there. They were working on developing a machine learning model for demand forecasting
    and pricing, a topic I had throughly enjoyed studying during my time at UC Berkeley.
    Witnessing the practical application of machine learning in business was incredibly
    rewarding. Seeking guidance, I turned to a data scientist I knew at the company.
    He advised me to pursue further education to become a data scientist, especially
    considering the visa challenges I faced as an international student.'

    (CMU). Taking the Statistical Computing course with Professor Alex Reinhart enhanced
    my Python skills, while the Data Mining course from Professor Sivaraman Balakrishnan
    prepared me well for machine learning interviews. I went to their office hours
    almost every week and they were tremendously helpful. The quality education I
    received at CMU enabled me to leverage my coding skills, project experiences,
    and coursework knowledge to successfully navigate data science interviews.

    targeting junior data scientist positions. I didn’t know which company was hiring
    foreign employees, so I applied all. Despite the uncertainty, I received responses
    from over 20 companies and progressed to the final stages with 4 of them, all
    of which extended job offers.
