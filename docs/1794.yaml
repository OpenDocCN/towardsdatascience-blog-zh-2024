    hard**. By production-level, I mean, systems that have a certain level of reliability
    that add value to the company’s top and bottom line. Embedding ML systems into
    organizations is not an overnight’s job and, honestly, Data Science and Machine
    Learning gets a bad rep just because leaders get lost in the process. Particularly,
    I see two types of mistakes when trying to experiment with ML first:'

    ML vendors. High expectations about ML and AI systems are normally caused by people
    that want to sell those systems (or by media hype). But hear me out: every ML
    system has error and there’s no other way around it.'
