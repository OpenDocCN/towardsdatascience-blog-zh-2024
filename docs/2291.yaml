- en: In most common Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, achieving optimal
    performance often involves a trade-off between the **amount of data** used for
    training and the resulting **model accuracy**. This blog post explores the concept
    of **sample efficiency** in the context of fine-tuning Google’s Gemini Flash model
    using a PII masking dataset as a practical example. We’ll examine how fine-tuning
    with increasing amounts of data impacts the tuned model’s capabilities.

- en: Sample efficiency refers to a model’s ability to achieve high accuracy with
    a limited amount of training data. It’s a key aspect of ML development, especially
    when dealing with tasks or domains where large, **labeled datasets might be scarce
    or expensive to acquire**. A sample-efficient model can learn effectively from
    fewer examples, reducing the time, cost, and effort associated with data collection
    and training. LLMs were shown to be very sample efficient, even capable of doing
    in-context learning with few examples to significantly boost performance. The
    main motivation of this blog post is to explore this aspect using Gemini Flash
    as an example. We will evaluate this…
