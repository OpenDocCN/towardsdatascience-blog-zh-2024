    talked about algorithms inspired by [genetics](/evolutionary-algorithm-mutations-explained-4a3b5c2d49de?sk=e3e2305821577766713f14b8240e8459),

    Today, I will talk about wolves.

    some serious business going on. Grey Wolf Optimizer [1] (GWO) is one such example.

- en: Like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), and Ant
    Colony Optimization (ACO), GWO is also a meta-heuristic. Although there’s no mathematical
    guarantees to the solution, it works well in practice and does not require any
    analytical knowledge of the underlying problem. This allows us to query from a
    ‘blackbox’, and simply make use to the observed results to refine our solution.

    concept of explore-exploit trade-off. Why, then, are there so many different meta-heuristics?

    job entails exploring things from different angles and sharing the ways in which…
