If the software is dysfunctional, the organization is dysfunctional. The same can play out in reverse, as organizational structure dysfunction plays out in the software. All this means that a company that wants to win in its category can end up executing poorly compared to its competitors and being too slow to respond to market conditions.

It went viral and everyone was talking about data contracts, though the concrete details of how one would implement them were scarce. But the objective was clear: fix the broken pipelines problem.</p><p id="03ac" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">Broken pipelines for many reasons:</p><ul class=""><li id="2e5a" class="nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx pa pb pc bk">Software engineers had no idea what data engineers were building on top of their application databases and therefore provided no guarantees around table schema changes nor even warned of impending changes that would break the pipelines (usually because they had no idea).</li><li id="2daf" class="nc nd fq ne b go pd ng nh gr pe nj nk nl pf nn no np pg nr ns nt ph nv nw nx pa pb pc bk">Data engineers had been largely unable (due to organizational dysfunction or organizational isolation) to develop healthy peer relationships with the software teams they depend on. Or if relationships could be built, there wasn’t buy-in from software team leaders to help data teams get the data they needed beyond giving them database credentials. The result was to just reach in and grab the data at the source, breaking the age-old software engineering practice of encapsulation in the process (and suffering the results).</li></ul><p id="53e0" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">I recently listened to <a class="af nz" href="https://youtu.be/yNLVmhKp8wM?t=303" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Super Data Science E825</a> with Chad Sanderson, a big proponent of data contracts. I loved how he defined the term:</p><blockquote class="oa ob oc"><p id="efc6" class="nc nd ny ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">My definition of data quality is a bit different from other people’s. In the software world, people think about quality as, it’s very deterministic. So I am writing a feature, I am building an application, I have a set of requirements for that application and if the software no longer meets those requirements that is known as a bug, it’s a quality issue. But in the data space you might have a producer of data that is emitting data or collecting data in some way, that makes a change which is totally sensible for their use case. As an example, maybe I have a column called timestamp that is being recorded in local time, but I decide to change that to UTC format. Totally fine, makes complete sense, probably exactly what you should do. But if there’s someone downstream of me that’s expecting local time, they’re going to experience a data quality issue. So my perspective is that data quality is actually a result of mismanaged expectations between the data producers and data consumers, and that is the function of the data contract. It’s to help these two sides actually collaborate better with each other.<em class="fq"> </em>— Chad Sanderson</p></blockquote><p id="70c7" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">What constitutes a data contract is still somewhat open to interpretation and implementation regarding actual concrete technology and patterns. Schema management is a central theme, though only one part of the solution. A data contract is not only about specifying the shape of the data (its schema); it’s also about trust and dependability, and we can look to the REST API community to understand this point:</p><ul class=""><li id="abcb" class="nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx pa pb pc bk">REST APIs are regularly documented via <a class="af nz" href="https://www.openapis.org/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">OpenAPI</a>, a REST API specification tool. This is essentially the schema of the request and the response, as well as the security schemes.</li><li id="8bdf" class="nc nd fq ne b go pd ng nh gr pe nj nk nl pf nn no np pg nr ns nt ph nv nw nx pa pb pc bk">REST APIs are versioned, and great care is taken to version them without making breaking changes. When breaking changes do occur, the API releases a new major version. The topic of API versioning is deep, with a long history of debate about which options are best. But the point is that the software engineering community has thought long and hard about how to evolve APIs.</li><li id="c73a" class="nc nd fq ne b go pd ng nh gr pe nj nk nl pf nn no np pg nr ns nt ph nv nw nx pa pb pc bk">A REST API that is constantly changing and releasing new major versions due to breaking changes is a poor API. Organizations that publish APIs for their customers must ensure that not only do they create a well-modeled and specified API, but a stable one that does not change too frequently.</li></ul><p id="9982" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">In software engineering, when Service A needs the data of Service B, what Service A absolutely doesn’t do is just access the private database of Service B. What happens is the following:</p><ol class=""><li id="6e3a" class="nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx pn pb pc bk">The engineering leaders/teams of the two services open a line of communication, likely a physical conversation to begin with.</li><li id="dede" class="nc nd fq ne b go pd ng nh gr pe nj nk nl pf nn no np pg nr ns nt ph nv nw nx pn pb pc bk">The team of Service A arranges for a well-designed interface for Service B that doesn’t break the encapsulation of Service A. This may result in a REST API, or perhaps an event stream or queue that Service B can consume.</li><li id="3784" class="nc nd fq ne b go pd ng nh gr pe nj nk nl pf nn no np pg nr ns nt ph nv nw nx pn pb pc bk">The team of Service A commits to maintaining this API/stream/queue going forward. This involves the discipline of evolving it over time, providing a stable and predictable interface for Service B to use. Some of this maintenance can fall on a platform team whose responsibility is to provide building block infrastructure for development teams to use.</li></ol><p id="943a" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">Why does the team of Service A do this for the team of Service B? Is it out of altruism? No. They collaborate because it is valuable for the business for them to do so. A well-run organization is run with the mantra of #OneTeam, and the organization does what is necessary to operate efficiently and effectively. That means that team Service A sometimes has to do work for the benefit of another team. It happens because of alignment of incentives going up the management chain.</p><p id="be27" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">It is also well known in software engineering that fixing bugs late in the development cycle, or worse, in production, is significantly more expensive than addressing them early on. It is disruptive to the software process to go back to previous work from a week or a month before, and bugs in production can lead to all manner of ills. A little upfront work on producing well-modeled, stable APIs makes life easier for everyone. There is a saying for this: <em class="ny">an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure</em>.</p><p id="5649" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">These APIs are contracts. They are established by opening communication between software teams and implemented when it is clear that the ROI makes it worth it. It really comes down to that. It generally works like this inside a software engineering department due to the aligned incentives of software leadership.</p><h2 id="52fa" class="po oe fq bf of pp pq pr oi ps pt pu ol nl pv pw px np py pz qa nt qb qc qd qe bk">Data products</h2><p id="b36f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go pi ng nh gr pj nj nk nl pk nn no np pl nr ns nt pm nv nw nx fj bk">The term API (or Application Programming Interface) doesn’t quite fit “data”. Because the product is the data itself, rather than interface over some business logic, the term “data product” fits better. The word product also implies that there is some kind of quality attached, some level of professionalism and dependability. That is why data contracts are intimately related to data products, with data products being a materialization of the more abstract data contract.</p><p id="d17d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">Data products are very similar to the REST APIs on the software side. It comes down to the opening up of communication channels between teams, the rigorous specification of the shape of the data (including the time zone from Chad’s words earlier), careful evolution as inevitable changes occur, and the commitment of the data producers to maintain stable data APIs for the consumers. The difference is that a data product will typically be a table or a stream (the data itself), rather than an HTTP REST API, which typically drives some logic or retrieves a single entity per call.</p><p id="fdc6" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">Another key insight is that just as APIs make services reusable in a predictable way, data products make data processing work more reusable. In the software world, once the Orders API has been released, all downstream services that need to interact with the orders sub-system do so via that API. There aren’t a handful of single-use interfaces set up for each downstream use case. Yet that is exactly what we often see in data engineering, with single-use pipelines and multiple copies of the source data for different use cases.</p><p id="a427" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">Simply put, software engineering promotes reusability in software through modularity (be it actual software modules or APIs). Data products do the same for data.</p><h1 id="4975" class="od oe fq bf of og oh gq oi oj ok gt ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou ov ow ox oy bk">Shift Left</h1><p id="9f4b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go pi ng nh gr pj nj nk nl pk nn no np pl nr ns nt pm nv nw nx fj bk">Shift Left came out of the cybersecurity space. Security has also historically been another silo where software and security teams operate under different reporting structures, use different tools, have different incentives, and share little common vocabulary. The result has been a growing security crisis that we’ve become so used to now that the next multi-million record breach barely gets reported. We’re so used to it that we might not even consider it a crisis, but when you look at the trail of destruction left by ransomware gangs, information stealers, and extortionists, it’s hard to argue that this should be business as usual.</p><p id="6303" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">The idea of Shift Left is to shift the security focus left to where software is being developed, rather than being applied after the fact, by a separate team with little knowledge of the software being developed, modified, and deployed. Not only is it about integrating security earlier in the development process, it’s also about improving the quality of cyber telemetry. The heterogeneity and general “messiness” of cyber telemetry drive this movement of shifting processing, clean up, and contextualization to the left where the data production is. Reasoning about this data becomes so challenging once provenance is lost. While cyber data is unusually challenging, the lessons learned in this space are generalizable to other domains, such as data analytics.</p><p id="3bdf" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">The similarity of the silos of cybersecurity and data analytics is striking. Silos assume that the silo function can operate as a discrete unit, separated from other business functions. However, both cybersecurity and data analytics are cross-functional and must interact with many different areas of a business. Cross-functional teams can’t operate to the side, behind the scenes, or after the fact. Silos don’t work, and shift-left is about toppling the silos and replacing them with something less centralized and more embedded in the process of software development.</p><p id="a620" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">Bernd Wessely wrote a <a class="af nz" rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="/data-architecture-lessons-learned-3589b152a8a6">fantastic article</a> on <a class="af nz" href="https://towardsdatascience.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TowardsDataScience </a>about the silo problem. In it he argues that the data analytics silo can be so engrained that the current practices are not questioned. That the silo comprised of an ingest-then-process paradigm is “<em class="ny">only a workaround for inappropriate data management. A workaround necessary because of the completely inadequate way of dealing with data in the enterprise today.</em>”</p><p id="8934" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">The sad thing is that none of this is new. I’ve been reading articles about breaking silos all my career, and yet here we are in 2024, still talking about the need to break them! But break them we must!</p><p id="38de" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">If the data silo is the centralized monolith, separated from the rest of an organization’s software, then shifting left is about integrating the data infrastructure into where the software lives, is developed, and operated.</p><p id="7307" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">Service B didn’t just reach into the private internals of Service A; instead, an interface was created that allowed Service A to get data from Service B without violating encapsulation. This interface, an API, queue, or stream, became a stable method of data consumption that didn’t break every time Service A needed to change its hidden internals. The burden of providing that interface was placed on the team of Service A because it was the right solution, but there was also a business case to do so. The same applies with Shift Left; instead of placing the ownership of making data available on the person who wants to use the data, you place that ownership upstream to where the data is produced and maintained.</p><p id="3ff7" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">At the center of this shift to the left is the data product. The data product, be it an event stream or an Iceberg table, is often best managed by the team that owns the underlying data. This way, we avoid the kludges, the rushed, jerry-rigged solutions that bypass good practices.</p><p id="1ce2" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">To make this a reality, we need the following:</p><ul class=""><li id="8a86" class="nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx pa pb pc bk">Communication and alignment between the parties involved.
