As we divide the problem into sub-problems, we have to keep track of all of the different “branches” that we generate. Branches split into more branches, creating a complex tree structure. I call this <strong class="nd fr">The Branching Problem</strong>.</p><p id="1d3d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nb nc fq nd b go ne nf ng gr nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw fj bk">We’ll explore a couple methods for using GPT-based tools to create well-defined output artifacts as part of an app design pipeline.
