developing AI-based solutions, and finally, organizations that aim to use AI for positive impact or to support their businesses. When initiatives to deploy AI in the last group take place, capacity building and training are mostly oriented towards technical infrastructure, data ecosystems or technical skills; and although its significance is indisputable, we fail to understand that in most cases, AI solutions aren’t just a tool approach; it’s about well-understood use cases and ways to measure their impact.
