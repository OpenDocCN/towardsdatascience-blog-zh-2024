    While sending over commented code might suffice in some cases, there are times
    when this just isn’t enough.

    it incredibly counterintuitive from a programming perspective because of its syntax.
    But my main problem with it is that it isn’t clear the best way to share your
    work if it isn’t by sharing the data and the do file, so the other person can
    run it by themselves.

    the other person just wants to see the results and understand how you achieved
    them. Running the code themselves can be time-consuming at best and a logistical
    challenge at worst.

    economic research.

    by using the *webdoc* command.
