    to look at? How do you know when you’re done? What if you miss something important?
    In my experience, you can alleviate some of these worries with communication and
    expectation-setting. I’m sharing my process for exploratory data analysis here
    as a resource for folks just getting started in data, and for more experienced
    analysts and data scientists seeking to hone their own processes.*'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the first things you should do when starting an exploratory analysis
    is to talk to the product manager/ leadership/ stakeholder(s) responsible for
    making decisions using the output of the analysis. Develop a solid understanding
    of the decisions they need to make, or the types of changes/ interventions they
    need to make calls on.

- en: If you’re supporting product iterations, it may also be helpful to speak with
    UX researchers, designers, or customer service representatives who interact with
    customers or receive end-user feedback. You can add a lot of value by understanding
    whether a customer request is viable, or identifying patterns in user behavior
    that indicate the need for a specific feature.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These conversations will help you determine the analysis goals, i.e., whether
    you should focus on identifying patterns and relationships, understanding distributions,
    etc. Summarize your understanding of the goal(s), specify an analysis period and
    population, and make sure all relevant stakeholders are aligned. At this point,
    I also like to communicate non-goals of the analysis — things stakeholders should
    *not* expect to see as part of my deliverable(s).

    time periods, new users, users in a certain age bracket or geographical area,
    etc.

    relevant data is easily available, and what supplemental data is potentially accessible.
    Verify your permissions to each data source, and request access from data/ process
    owners for any supplemental datasets. Spend some time familiarizing yourself with
    the datasets, and rule out any questions on your list it’s not possible to answer
    with the data you have.

- en: Do a prioritization exercise with the key stakeholder(s), for example, a product
    manager, to understand which questions they believe are most important. It’s a
    good idea to T-shirt size (S, M, L) the complexity of the questions on your list
    before this conversation to illustrate the level of effort to answer them. If
    the questions on your list are more work than is feasible in a single analysis,
    use those prioritizations to determine how to stagger them into multiple analyses.

    the need for data cleaning (looking for outliers, missingness/ sparse data, duplicates,
    etc.), and perform any necessary cleaning steps. If not, create data pipelines
    to handle any required relocation or transformations before data cleaning.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Start the analysis with high-level statistical exploration to understand distributions
    of features and correlations between them. You may notice data sparsity or quality
    issues that impact your ability to answer questions from your analysis planning
    exercise. It’s important to communicate early to stakeholders about questions
    you cannot address, or that will have “noisy” answers less valuable for decision-making.

    for the analysis. I like to visualize as I go, as this can make it easier to spot
    patterns, trends, and anomalies, and I can drop interesting visuals right into
    my write-up draft.

    features (ex: bucket ranges for a numeric feature, indicators for whether a specific
    action was taken within a given period or more times than a given threshold) to
    explore correlations further, and look for less intuitive relationships between
    features using machine learning.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I like the question framework for analyses because it makes it easy to document
    my findings as I go. As you conduct your analysis, note answers you find under
    each question. Highlight findings you think are interesting, and make notes on
    any trains of thought a finding sparked.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This decreases the work that you need to do at the end of your analysis, and
    you can focus on fleshing out your findings with the “so what?” that tells the
    audience why they should care about a finding, and the “what next?” recommendations
    that make your insights actionable. When that’s in place, reorganize questions
    as necessary to create a consistent “storyline” for the analysis and key findings.
    At the end, you can include any next steps or additional lines of inquiry you
    recommend the team look into based on your findings.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When your analysis is ready to share with the original stakeholders, be thoughtful
    about the format you choose. Depending on the audience, they may respond best
    to a Slack post, a presentation, a walkthrough of the analysis document, or some
    combination of the above. Finally, promote your analysis in internal channels,
    just in case your findings are useful to teams you weren’t working with.
