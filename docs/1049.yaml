    work may have been around for centuries, but that doesn’t mean we should approach
    the topic as if we only learn it once and then store away our knowledge in some
    dusty mental attic. Practical approaches, tools, and use cases evolve all the
    time—and with them comes the need to stay up-to-date.

    idea behind N-of-1 studies is that you can draw meaningful insights even when
    the data you’re using is based on input from a single person. It has far-reaching
    potential for designing individualized healthcare strategies, or, in the case
    of [Merete Lutz](https://medium.com/u/74e172eb9747?source=post_page---user_mention--3da19a5184c2--------------------------------)’s
    fascinating project, establishing meaningful connections between alcohol consumption

    and statistical operations, and outlines a solution for building an LLM-based
    math app using LangChain agents, OpenAI, and Chainlit.'

    become much more accessible and intuitive for learners. That’s precisely what
    [Sachin Date](https://medium.com/u/b75b5b1730f3?source=post_page---user_mention--3da19a5184c2--------------------------------)
