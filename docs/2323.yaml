- en: When you build a chart with data that is not ours, you must cite the source
    from which you took the data. This serves to do justice to the work done by others
    and increase your credibility towards those who will look at the graph. If you
    cite the data source, your chart will surely be more authoritative because it
    is based on verifiable data.

    of the story. Although this placement may generate trust, it could also be distracting

- en: You have seen how to place credits in a chart. If you have read carefully, at
    a certain point, precisely in the last type of placement—sideways—I talked about
    the main data story workflow. But what is it exactly? Any chart, if done well,
    tells a story, and a story normally follows a flow from the initial scene to its
    completion, with the final scene.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Even in a simple chart, you can tell a story, and precisely, a story in a chart
    has three main points: a beginning, a main point, and a final part.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The beginning corresponds to the context used to frame the chart's content.
    Usually, you can insert the context immediately under the title, but you can also
    put it in other parts, such as on the left of the chart. In general, insert the
    context before the main chart so the reader can read it before the graph.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then, there is the main point that corresponds precisely to your chart.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, there is the final part of the story, which corresponds to the next
    steps. Place the next steps at the bottom, i.e., below the chart or to the right,
    so the reader will read them after reading the other parts of the graph.

    in your chart. You have the following options: under the title/subtitle, under
    the main chart, under the next steps, or sideways.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Choosing one solution over another depends on your aesthetic taste and the space
    you have in the chart. The important thing is that the credits do not hinder the
    normal flow of the story.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a small final tip. If you can, always add a link to the data source
    in the credits so that the reader can personally verify the integrity of the data
    you show in your chart.
