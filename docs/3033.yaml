- en: Data science is undoubtedly one of the most fascinating fields today. Following
    significant breakthroughs in machine learning about a decade ago, data science
    has surged in popularity within the tech community. Each year, we witness increasingly
    powerful tools that once seemed unimaginable. Innovations such as the *Transformer
    architecture*, *ChatGPT*, the *Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG*) framework,
    and state-of-the-art *computer vision models* — including *GANs* — have had a
    profound impact on our world.

    can be overwhelming — especially for beginners — to determine which skills to
    prioritize when aiming for a career in data science. Moreover, this field is highly
    demanding, requiring substantial dedication and perseverance.

    the main data science areas can be divided into three large categories: **maths,
    software engineering and machine learning**. In this article, we will focus on
    software engineering skills that learners need to master to become a data scientist.'
