- en: Geospatial indexing, or Geocoding, is the process of indexing latitude-longitude
    pairs to small subdivisions of geographical space, and it is a technique that
    we data scientists often find ourselves using when faced with geospatial data.

- en: Though the first popular geospatial indexing technique “Geohash” was invented
    as recently as 2008, indexing latitude-longitude pairs to manageable subdidivisions
    of space is hardly a new concept. Governments have been breaking up their land
    into states, provinces, counties, and postal codes for centuries for all sorts
    of applications, such as taking censuses and aggregating votes for elections.

    use modern computational techniques to execute such spatial subdividing, and we
    do so for our own purposes: analytics, feature-engineering, granular AB testing
    by geographic subdivision, indexing geospatial databases, and more.'

- en: Geospatial indexing is a thoroughly developed area of computer science, and
    geospatial indexing tools can bring a lot of power and richness to our models
    and analyses. What makes geospatial indexing techniques further exciting, is that
    a look under their proverbial hoods reveals eclectic amalgams of other mathematical
    tools, such as space-filling curves, map projections, tessellations, and more!
