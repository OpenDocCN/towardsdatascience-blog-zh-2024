    to overlook the tried and tested Machine Learning algorithms of yore (they’re
    actually not that old…). I would go so far as to argue that for most business
    cases, a straightforward Machine Learning solution will go further than most complex
    AI implementation. Not only do ML algorithms scale extremely well, the far lower
    model complexity is what (in my opinion) makes them superior in most scenarios.
    Not to mention, I have also had a far easier time tracking the performance of
    such ML solutions.

    More specifically, I will show how one can (in only a few lines of code) identify
    feature importance within a dataset using a Random Forest classifier. I’ll start
    by demonstrating the effectiveness of this technique. I’ll then apply a ‘back-to-basics’
    approach to show how this method works under the hood by creating a Decision Tree
    and a Random Forest from scratch whilst benchmarking the models along the way.
