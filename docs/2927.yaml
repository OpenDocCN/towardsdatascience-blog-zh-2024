- en: I have been increasingly reviewing resumes and conducting phone screens and
    interviews to hire our next scientist and as a result, I have been thinking more
    than ever about the detailed expectations that I have from our data and applied
    scientists. As a result, I recently wrote a post about the mathematics that I
    look for in our data scientist interviews, which was very well received by the
    readers (linked below) and therefore, I decided to continue that discussion by
    going much deeper into the machine learning knowledge that we expect our data
    scientists to have in this post.

    there but I still decided to write this post because I wasn’t able to refer candidates
    to one comprehensive source to prepare for their interviews or day-to-day ML tasks
    as a data scientist. If you are preparing for a data scientist interview or just
    plan to refresh your memory of the related topics, I believe you will find this
    post helpful.

    the tables, which I am personally very proud of making, and if you find them helpful,
    mark the post for your future reference and reading.
