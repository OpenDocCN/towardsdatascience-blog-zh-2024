- en: In this article, I will go through the architecture behind N-HiTS, particularly
    the differences to N-BEATS. But do not be afraid, the deep dive will be easy-to-understand.
    However, it is not enough to only understand how N-HiTS works. Thus, I will show
    you how we can easily implement a N-HiTS model in Python and also tune its hyperparameters.
