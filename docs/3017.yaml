    of autonomous agents will soon be upon us. But what is an “autonomous agent”?

- en: '[Sebastian Thielke](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastianthielke/), Platform
    Economics Lead at AWS, describes it like this (paraphrasing): “An autonomous agent
    reacts to environmental stimuli, is proactive in pursuit of a goal(s), has social
    interaction capabilities, and can continuously learn and improve”. Wikipedia offers
    a similar [definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_agent): “autonomous
    agents are computational systems that inhabit some complex dynamic environment,
    sense and act autonomously in this environment, and by doing so realize a set
    of goals or tasks for which they are designed.” And in a previous [article](/agentic-mesh-the-future-of-generative-ai-enabled-autonomous-agent-ecosystems-d6a11381c979),
    I offered the following definition which I think captures both: autonomous agents
    use agentic AI (sophisticated reasoning and iterative planning) to independently
    plan and execute tasks.'

    What does an autonomous agent (hereinafter called an “agent”) architecture look
    like, and what are its major components? What capabilities need to be in place
    to create a “smart” agent that can plan and execute tasks? And since no agent
    stands alone but rather works in an ecosystem of…'
