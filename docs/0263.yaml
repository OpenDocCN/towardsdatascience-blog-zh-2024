- en: I needed a data warehouse tool for my new data project recently. This story
    is about how I built it from scratch and organized everything in it. Designing
    a data platform is not a trivial task and often modern data warehouse solutions
    are at the center of its architecture. It provides robust data governance features,
    simplified data querying using ANSI SQL and enhanced data modelling capabilities.
    Organising everything inside, i.e. data environments, tests, naming conventions,
    databases, schemas and tables might be a challenging task due to the high number
    of data sources and complexity of required transformations. This story might be
    useful for beginner and intermediate-level users who would like to learn advanced
    data warehousing techniques. With seasoned data practitioners, I would like to
    discuss what they think about data warehouse design and how they would typically
    organize everything inside.

- en: As a data engineer, I design data pipelines every day. This is what modern data
    platform consists of and it must be cost-effective, scalable and easy to maintain
    in the long run. Designing pipelines for data-intensive applications is always
    challenging and a modern **data warehouse** (DWH) aims to simplify and enhance
    thisâ€¦
