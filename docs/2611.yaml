    working halfway through a code change. Your attempt to switch branch fails because
    of uncommitted changes in your current feature branch. These changes aren‚Äôt ready
    for a commit but are too valuable to discard. In such a situation where you need
    to switch contexts quickly, `git stash` offers an elegant solution to temporarily
    store your unfinished code safely without committing. In this post, we will explore
    how to use `git stash` effectively.

    to write another more urgent letter and send it away. Our desk can hold only one
    letter. It would be too wasteful to throw our unfinished letter since it took
    us some time to write what‚Äôs written so far. Instead of throwing it away, we can
    put it away in a secure chest so that we can pick it up and continue once we finish
    this more time-sensitive letter. This will allow us to get straight on to writing
    this more urgent letter and send it quickly while saving our work on the other
    letter. In this analogy, halfway written letter is the uncommitted‚Ä¶
