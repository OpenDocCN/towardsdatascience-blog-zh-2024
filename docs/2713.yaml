- en: You may not realize it, but you’ve been interacting with Knowledge Graphs (KGs)
    more frequently than you might think. They’re the technology behind many modern
    search engines, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for Large Language
    Models (LLMs), and various query tools. But what exactly are Knowledge Graphs,
    and why are they so integral to these technologies? Let’s delve into it.

- en: A Knowledge Graph (KG) is a structured representation of information that captures
    real-world entities and the relationships between them. Imagine a network where
    each point represents an entity — such as a product, person, or concept — and
    the lines connecting them represent the relationships they share. This interconnected
    web allows for a rich semantic understanding of data, where the focus isn’t just
    on individual pieces of information but on how these pieces relate to one another.
