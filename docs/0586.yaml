- en: Data durability in data pipeline design is a well-known pain point in the data
    engineering space. It is a well-known fact that data availability and data quality
    issues can lead to a significant increase in time on non-value-added tasks. In
    this story, I would like to speak about data engineering design patterns for data
    pipelines to ensure data is always there. We will speak about techniques that
    might help us to build a sustainable data transformation process where data is
    always delivered on time and our data pipeline can be described as robust, durable
    and maybe even self-fixing.

    manual tasks including unnecessary data sourcing, aggregation and processing to
    get to the desired outcome.

- en: '**Data durability** is a renowned risk factor in data engineering. In my opinion,
    it is the least discussed topic online at the moment. However, simply because
    you donâ€™t see the problem it doesnâ€™t mean it is not there. Data engineers might
    not speak of it often. The issue though exists, seeding fear among data practitioners
    and turning data pipeline design into a real challenge.'
