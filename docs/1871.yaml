- en: Technical debt, as defined by [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/technical-debt),
    is the accumulated work “owed” to an IT system due to shortcuts and sacrifices
    made during software development. These compromises are often necessary to meet
    delivery deadlines but can lead to deviations from the software’s nonfunctional
    requirements, eventually impacting performance, scalability, and resilience.

    are often critical to day-to-day operations. When these systems fail, the consequences
    can be severe, posing challenges such as code complexity, high development costs,
    and the risk of security vulnerabilities, which can paralyze even the most innovative
    companies.
