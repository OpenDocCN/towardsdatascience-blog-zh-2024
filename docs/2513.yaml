  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the world of e-commerce, relying on individual metrics to assess product
    and brand performance can be misleading. Metrics, in isolation, can create a false
    sense of success, leading to overinvestment in products that appear profitable
    but are actually draining your business’s resources or, conversely, undervaluing
    items with untapped potential.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To stay ahead, you need a *holistic view* — one that evaluates product and brand
    performance across several key metrics like ‘gross revenue’, ‘conversion rate’,
    ‘gross margin’, ‘customer acquisition cost’, ‘repeat purchase rate’, ‘fulfillment
    costs’ and ‘return rate’.

    with. To protect client confidentiality and ensure privacy, the data shown here
    is synthetic, generated using AI. Although it includes a variety of important
    metrics, teams often only focus on the metric most relevant to their goals which
    can obscure the bigger picture. For instance, sorting by `sales_gross_amount`

- en: To avoid these pitfalls of single metric assessment and to gain a more accurate
    evaluation of product and brand performance across multiple metrics, we use a
    method called **Weighted Composite Scoring.**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A Weighted Composite Score combines multiple metrics into a single, insightful
    metric that provides a comprehensive view of each product’s value across various
    dimensions. Think of it like your final grade in school — each subject may be
    assessed on a different scale, but ultimately they are combined into one overall
    score.

    you to align with particular business goals such as prioritising profitability
    over growth or reducing return rates.

    ensuring that each metric contributes equally to the final analysis.

    metrics. This allows the user to give greater importance to certain metrics based
    on business priorities or objectives. Different departments may prioritise different
    metrics depending on their focus. For example, the Marketing team might be more
    interested in customer acquisition and conversion, where **conversion rate**,
    **customer acquisition cost (CAC)**, and **repeat purchase rate** are key indicators
    of success.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    negative factors for a product’s performance. By applying negative weights, we
    ensure that higher values in these metrics lower the overall composite score,

    score is to use regression analysis. This method assigns weights based on each
    metric’s actual influence on key outcomes, such as overall profitability or customer
    retention. By doing so, the most impactful metrics naturally carry more weight
    in the final composite score.

- en: Thanks to the positive and negative Z-scores, we can clearly see in Table 1
    that while **Towel 17** excels in sales and profitability, it struggles with repeat
    purchases and has a high return rate — potential indicators of quality or customer
    satisfaction issues. Addressing these challenges could result in significant improvements
    in both profitability and customer loyalty.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In Table 2, we can see that **Cushion 152** performs exceptionally well in terms
    of profitability (high gross margin and low costs), with solid conversion rates
    and a low return rate. While it doesn’t have the highest sales, it stands out
    as a top performer overall due to its efficiency and customer satisfaction. I
    would recommend that this website increase this product’s visibility through targeted
    marketing campaigns and feature it more prominently on the site to drive additional
    sales.

    unnecessary cuts to products & brands that were mistakenly thought to be underperforming.
