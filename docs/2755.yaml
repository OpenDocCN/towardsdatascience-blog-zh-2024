    these issues are likely common across many agencies. This prompted me to write
    this blog, aiming to share useful insights and offer practical solutions.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Reporting sometimes took *days* to complete. One agency had to gather reports
    from multiple global markets, while the other relied on several staff members
    across the business to update and send the data from their systems. If someone
    was on annual leave, that data point was simply marked as ‘TBC’ in the reports.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '***Issues with Excel’s stability & scalability:***'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both agencies were handling large volumes of data, and, as many of us know all
    too well, Excel has a tendency to struggle and crash under these workloads. This
    frequent freezing and crashing in Excel, particularly during pivot creation, made
    deeper analysis very cumbersome. The teams often had to force Excel to restart,
    sometimes risking the loss of their work.

- en: '***The limitations of Excel’s visualisations***'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Excel offers a relatively limited range of visualisations, making it harder
    to present data in diverse, insightful ways. While simple visuals are often the
    best choice for final presentations, the exploratory phase demands more advanced
    visuals to analyse data from multiple perspectives and uncover deeper insights.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Excel offers limited interactivity between visualisations compared to more advanced
    tools, which provide a more seamless and dynamic experience for data exploration.
    For instance, in a tool like Power BI, you can click on a region within one visual,
    and all related visuals (such as sales trends, customer demographics, or product
    categories) immediately update to display only the relevant data for that selection.
    This level of interactivity is invaluable for uncovering deeper insights and understanding
    the factors behind changes in the data.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Deeper analysis is crucial for making the most impactful decisions each month.
    It’s what separates a standard report that simply shows whether numbers are up
    or down month-over-month from a truly exceptional one, where you can propose proactive
    solutions, craft innovative strategies, and uncover untapped opportunities. By
    investing time in this level of analysis, you not only address immediate concerns
    but also position yourself as a key partner in your client’s long-term growth.

- en: 3\. Excessive time and resources spent on creating visually appealing graphs
    outside of Excel
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because Excel’s visualisations tend to look a bit, well, clunky, one of the
    agencies outsourced the creation of polished, branded visuals to their designer
    each month. As with most design projects, this involved a lot of back-and-forth
    discussions about how these new visuals should look.
  prefs: []

- en: 4\. Data skills gaps led to inaccurate reporting
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reporting was managed by someone without the necessary experience to fully
    understand Excel’s quirks , and understandably so, as it wasn’t part of their
    core role. As a result, both agencies unknowingly reported incorrect numbers.
    For example, even though the Revenue column was set to ‘Currency,’ entries like
    ‘USD123’ and ‘ 123’ (with a space) were excluded from the total because Excel
    didn’t recognize them as valid currency values. While Excel does offer a Data
    Validation feature to restrict entries to decimals or whole numbers, it must be
    applied manually, and many users aren’t aware of it. In my opinion, Excel should
    flag these discrepancies by default.

    limitations, which you can read about [here](https://www.xlwings.org/blog/my-thoughts-on-python-in-excel).
    In my opinion, working with Excel via a Python notebook is far more efficient
    for analysis and data wrangling.
