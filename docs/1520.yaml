    table for several Machine Learning Design interview questions. I’m hoping to share
    all the tips and tricks I have learned over time. By the end of this article,
    you’ll understand what to expect in this interview, what the interviewer is looking
    for, common mistakes/pitfalls made by candidates, and how to calibrate your responses
    according to role seniority/level. I will also follow this with a series of articles
    on common ML Design interview questions (with solutions). Stay tuned!

- en: An ML Design interview is a problem-solving session, with a special focus on
    ML business applications. The interview is to assess whether you can translate
    business problems to ML problems and walk through an end-to-end strategy to apply
    ML algorithms in the production environment.

- en: You’ll be given a real-world business problem, typically something related to
    the company you’re interviewing with or your area of expertise based on your resume.
    You are expected to drive the interview from start to finish, frequently checking
    in with the interviewer for direction and guidance on time management. The discussion
    is open-ended, often involving a white-boarding tool (like [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/))
    or shared document (like [Google docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/)). Typically,
    there is no coding required in this round.
