    multiple directions: the global economy, AI-powered tools and their effects on
    job security, and an ever-shifting tech stack, to name a few. Is it even possible
    to talk about recession-proofing or AI-proofing one’s career these days?'

    seen with the rise of LLMs in the past couple of years, things can and do change
    very quickly in this field (and in tech more broadly). That, however, doesn’t
    mean we should just resign ourselves to inaction, let alone despair.

    about our current position and what changes we’d like to see, and come up with
    a plan to adjust our skills, self-presentation, and mindset accordingly. The articles
    we’ve selected this week each tackle one (or more) of these elements, from excelling
    as an early-career data scientist to becoming an effective communicator. They
    offer pragmatic insights and a healthy dose of inspiration for practitioners across
    a wide range of roles and career stages. Let’s dive in!
