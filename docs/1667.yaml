- en: There is a lot of excitement surrounding the [new software](https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/)
    made possible by generative ai. Applications like natural language chatbots that
    respond intelligently to complex questions with custom knowledge pique interest
    because these applications were previously impossible. Generative ai has very
    quickly enabled a whole new set of applications, and this is justifiably exciting.

- en: Less exciting but equally impactful will be the replacement of traditional,
    custom-developed software with general purpose LLMs to solve software problems
    that we could already solve, but can now be implemented without problem-specific
    code. Generative ai is highly flexible and with a bit of prompt engineering a
    large language model (such as GPT-4o) can be used to solve a significant number
    of traditional software challenges. While it is exciting to build new things previously
    impossible (or highly infeasible), much of the impact of generative ai will be
    building differently what we can already build today.

- en: This shift from problem-specific application development to integrating problem-agnostic,
    generalist generative ai will change dominant architecture patterns, organizational
    skill set requirements, and cost-of-development equations. It is the reason why
    every development…
