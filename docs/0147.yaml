    with results that we had to break this post into two parts. This is Part II focusing

    the expressiveness of the data representations and maybe this way obtain more
    performant neural networks. Likely in the short term, we will be able to explore
    architectures that encompass several types of representations of the objects of
    interest and harness the best predictions for the evermore complex tasks we are
    facing as progressively more of the basic problems get solved. This notion of

    generation, thinking from a biochemical perspective the drug design problem starts
    by having a target to which a small molecule binds, therefore one of the first
    and most important constraints is that the generative process ought to be conditioned
    to the protein pocket. However, such a constraint may not be enough to create
    real small molecules as many of such chemicals are simply impossible or very hard
    to synthesize, and, therefore, a model that has notions of chemical synthesizability

    [dyMEAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.00203.pdf)) or at least solve the problem

    as valuable tools, even among those who primarily favour geometric deep learning.
    These embeddings are used to help docking models, allow the construction of simple
    yet competitive predictive models for binding affinity prediction ([Li et al 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39022-2)),

    (10·ê®¬π‚Åµ), that is, you‚Äôd need at least 1 million steps to simulate a nanosecond
    and that‚Äôs expensive. Modern ML-based methods for MD aim to speed it up by applying

    on a usual ‚Äúarsenal‚Äù slide of impactful GNN applications over the years. With
    2023 being significantly marked by LLM developments, I was wondering ‚Äî can I meaningfully
    update this slide, but only using models released this year?

    that 2023 was the **most exciting year** for cool GNN applications! The rise of
    LLMs just made it very clear where the limits of text-based autoregressive models
    are, and that for most scientific problems coming from Nature, their graph structure
    cannot be ignored.

    [TacticAI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10553), the *first full AI system giving
    useful tactical suggestions to (association) football coaches*, developed in partnership
    with our collaborators at Liverpool FC üî¥. TacticAI is capable of both predictive
    modelling (*‚Äúwhat will happen in this tactical scenario?‚Äù*), retrieving similar
    tactics, and conditional generative modelling (*‚Äúhow to modify player positions
    to make a particular outcome happen?‚Äù*). In my opinion, the most satisfying part
    of this very fun collaboration was our user study with some of LFC‚Äôs top coaching
    staff ‚Äî directly illustrating that the outputs of our model will be of use to
    coaches in their work üèÉ.

    to a graph representation. Each player is treated as a node in a graph, with node,
    edge and graph features extracted as detailed in the main text. Then, a graph
    neural network operates over this graph by performing message passing; each node‚Äôs
    representation is updated using the messages sent to it from its neighbouring
    nodes. (B), how TacticAI processes a given corner kick. To ensure that TacticAI‚Äôs
    answers are robust in the face of horizontal or vertical reflections, all possible
    combinations of reflections are applied to the input corner, and these four views
    are then fed to the core TacticAI model, where they are able to interact with
    each other to compute the final player representations ‚Äî each ‚Äúinternal blue arrow‚Äù
    corresponds to a single message passing layer from (A). Once player representations
    are computed, they can be used to predict the corner‚Äôs receiver, whether a shot
    has been taken, as well as assistive adjustments to player positions and velocities,
    which increase or decrease the probability of a shot being taken. Source: [Wang,
