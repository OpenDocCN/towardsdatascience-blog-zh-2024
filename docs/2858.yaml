- en: Batch normalization has become a very important technique for training neural
    networks in recent years. It makes training much more efficient and stable, which
    is a crucial factor, especially for large and deep networks. It was originally
    introduced to solve the problem of internal covariance shift.

- en: This article will examine the problems involved in training neural networks
    and how batch normalization can solve them. We will describe the process in detail
    and show how batch normalization can be implemented in Python and integrated into
    existing models. We will also consider the advantages and disadvantages of this
    method to determine whether it makes sense to use it.

- en: When training a [deep neural network](https://databasecamp.de/en/ml/artificial-neural-networks),
    [backpropagation](https://databasecamp.de/en/ml/backpropagation-basics) occurs
    after each run. The prediction error runs through the network layer by layer from
    behind. During this process, the weights of the individual neurons are then changed
    so that the error is reduced as quickly as possible. This changes the weights
    assuming that all other layers remain the…
