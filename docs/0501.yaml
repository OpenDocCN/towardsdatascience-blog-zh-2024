    that I received on [the previous installments](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/building-analytically-mature-organizations-amo-b54f8243ef3a)
    was that those articles might be too high level and it would be great to have

    the whole thing more actionable via a step-by-step on how to grow an organization’s

    by Ernesto Sirolli called “Want to help someone? Shut up and Listen”. In it, he
    explained how, as a 21 years-old, he worked for an Italian NGO which tried to
    “teach Zambian people how to grow food”. They successfully grew magnificent tomatoes
    in the valley down by the Zambezi river — but, as Sirolli puts in his own words:'

    step is going to shut up and just listen. You need to listen and understand the
    pain points, the different jobs, the data needs, what has been done in the past
    to solve those pain points, etc. Not only will this give you a better perspective
    of the lay of the land, it will also give you a better understanding of the people
    that are part of your organization.
