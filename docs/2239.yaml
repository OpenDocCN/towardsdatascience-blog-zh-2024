    value that robust data analysis can bring to nearly every aspect of daily life.
    We tend to focus on business outcomes and product development, and for good reasons,
    but the world stretches far beyond the common workflows of data scientists, and
    exploring the richness of the field can benefit practitioners regardless of the
    projects they’re currently working on.
