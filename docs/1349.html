In the beginning, this will seem like random anecdotes and noise, but after a while a pattern will start to emerge; and odds are, that pattern did not show in any of the standardized metrics you are tracking.</p><h1 id="71ed" class="ny nz fq bf oa ob oc gq od oe of gt og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot bk"><strong class="al">5.

Be open to changing your mind</h1><p id="769f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go ou ng nh gr ov nj nk nl ow nn no np ox nr ns nt oy nv nw nx fj bk">If you work with data, it’s natural to change your opinion on a regular basis. For example:</p><ul class=""><li id="eecf" class="nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx pj pb pc bk">You recommended a course of action to an executive, but have lost faith that it’s the right path forward since you got more data</li><li id="5908" class="nc nd fq ne b go pd ng nh gr pe nj nk nl pf nn no np pg nr ns nt ph nv nw nx pj pb pc bk">You interpreted a metric movement a certain way, but you ran an additional analysis and now you think something else is going on</li></ul><p id="363f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">However, most analytical people are hesitant to walk back on statements they made in the past out of fear of looking incompetent or angering stakeholders.</p><p id="449f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">That’s understandable; changing your recommendation typically means additional work for stakeholders to adjust to the new reality, and there is a risk they’ll be annoyed as a result.</p><p id="145a" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">Still, you shouldn’t stick to a prior recommendation simply out of fear of losing face. You won’t be able to do a good job defending an opinion once you’ve lost faith in it. Leaders like Jeff Bezos recognize the importance of changing your mind when confronted with new information, or simply when you’ve looked at an issue from a different angle. As long as you can clearly articulate why your recommendation changed, it is a sign of strength and intellectual rigor, not weakness.</p><blockquote class="pk pl pm"><p id="04b3" class="nc nd pi ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">Changing your mind a lot is so important.

You need to be pragmatic</h1><p id="f6fd" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go ou ng nh gr ov nj nk nl ow nn no np ox nr ns nt oy nv nw nx fj bk">When working in the Analytics realm, it’s easy to develop perfectionism. You’ve been trained on scientific methods, and pride yourself in knowing the ideal way to approach an analysis or experiment.</p><p id="6880" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">Unfortunately, the reality of running a business often puts severe constraints in our way. We need an answer faster than the experiment can provide statistically significant results, we don’t have enough users for a proper unbiased split, or our dataset doesn’t go back far enough to establish the time series pattern we’d like to look at.</p><p id="da1c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">It’s your job to help the teams running the business (those shipping the products, closing the deals etc.) get things done.

Don’t burn out your Data Scientists with ad-hoc requests</h1><p id="3f07" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go ou ng nh gr ov nj nk nl ow nn no np ox nr ns nt oy nv nw nx fj bk">Hiring full-stack data scientists to mostly build dashboards or do ad-hoc data pulls &amp; investigations all day is a surefire way to burn them out and have churn on the team.</p><p id="2b18" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">Many companies, esp. high-growth startups, are hesitant to hire Data Analysts or BI folks specifically dedicated to metric investigations and dashboard building. Headcount is limited, and managers want flexibility in what their teams can tackle, so they hire well-rounded Data Scientists and plan to give them the occasional dashboarding task or metrics investigation request.</p><p id="0357" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">In practice, however, this often balloons out of proportion and DS spend a disproportionate amount of time on these tasks. They get drowned in Slack pings that pull them out of their focused work, and “quick asks” (that are never as quick as they initially seem) add up to fill entire days, making it difficult to make progress on larger strategic projects in parallel.</p><p id="fc5b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">Luckily, there are solutions to this:</p><ol class=""><li id="63cc" class="nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx pa pb pc bk">Implement an AI chatbot that can field straightforward data questions</li><li id="0f2c" class="nc nd fq ne b go pd ng nh gr pe nj nk nl pf nn no np pg nr ns nt ph nv nw nx pa pb pc bk">Train relevant teams on basic SQL (at least 1–2 analysts per team) to make them more independent.

Encouraging this type of nimble, decentralized analytics rather than forcing everything through the bottleneck of a BI tool allows you to preserve the resources of Data Science teams (see #8 above) and equip the teams with what they need to succeed (basic SQL training, data modeling and visualization best practices etc.).</p><h1 id="131b" class="ny nz fq bf oa ob oc gq od oe of gt og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot bk">10. Having perfectly standardized metrics across the entire company is a pipe dream</h1><p id="4c9e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go ou ng nh gr ov nj nk nl ow nn no np ox nr ns nt oy nv nw nx fj bk">As discussed under #9 above, teams across the company will always unblock themselves by doing hacky analytics outside of BI tools, making it hard to enforce a shared data model. Esp. in fast-growing startups, it’s impossible to enforce perfect governance if you want to ensure teams can still move fast and get things done.</p><p id="268e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">While it gives many Data Scientists nightmares when metric definitions don’t match, in practice it’s not the end of the world.
