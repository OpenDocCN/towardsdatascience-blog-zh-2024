- en: Datathons or data hackathons, loosely defined as data or data science-centric
    hackathons, have become increasingly popular in recent years, providing a platform
    for participants and organisations to collaborate, innovate, and learn in the
    area of data science over a short timeframe.
  prefs: []

    constrained timeframe, necessitating an understanding of data science and an acute
    awareness of the data being used.

    ‘appropriate,’ ‘sufficient,’ and sensitive to privacy concerns. Organizers and
    participants often grapple with questions like: What makes data suitable for a
    datathon? How much data is considered enough? How do we handle sensitive data?
    Each dimension is crucial for ensuring the data used in datathons is suitable,
    ethical, and conducive to achieving the event’s objectives. Let’s dive into these
    aspects one by one.'

    collaborative datathon event organised by The Alan Turing Institute, the UK’s
    national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. ADSGs consist
    on a datathons that is worked collaboratively by a single team (rather than multiple
    teams competing with each other). The aim of DSGs is to provide opportunities
    for organisations and participants from academia and industry to work together
    to solve real-world challenges using data science and ML methodologies. The DSGs
    are managed and prepared by a specialised internal team of event organisers and
    interdisciplinary academic support staff. More info [[here]](https://www.turing.ac.uk/collaborate-turing/data-study-groups)

- en: The groundwork for a successful datathon is laid well before the event. Early
    engagement with challenge owners (business partners) is crucial. Their domain
    expertise and understanding of the data can significantly shape the event’s direction
    and outcomes. Their understanding of the problem and domain expertise can greatly
    improve the data, and early collaboration helps align the objectives and expectations
    on both sides, increasing the likelihood of a fruitful event.

    and consider changing the challenge questions based on input from an experience
    investigator that is able to align the industry requirements and the research
    requirements taking into consideration the perspective of participants.

    participants through data challenges and ensuring the objectives are met. Additionally,
    participant feedback is a goldmine. Their fresh eyes on the data can uncover new
    insights or identify areas for improvement, making the datathon a dynamic environment
    where adjustments are not just possible but encouraged.
