    yourself. By replacing just a *single variable* in the code below according to
    your household income, as indicated by `### just replace this with your data ###`,
    you will be able to create a chart showing your own percentile relative to households
    in Singapore! (And with additional work, you can replace the dataframe using data
    specific to your own country.)'
