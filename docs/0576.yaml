- en: This project utilizes a scenario based qualitative stress testing approach to
    identify US coastal census tracts expected to adversely impacted by sea level
    rise (SLR) in the medium (2050) and long term (2100). One Baseline and two ‘plausible
    but severe’ Adverse scenarios were designed covering 1–7ft of sea level rise.

- en: The key observations through this analysis were that that outside of current
    FEMA high risk areas, there are **~3500 other census tracts along the contiguous
    US coastline that are expected to experience an average SLR increase of 1ft in
    the medium term (by 2050).** Longer term (by 2100) an additional ~1660 census
    tracts are at risk for 2–7ft of SLR. The observations for the medium term are
    particularly important given that they are expected to materialize ***irrespective***
    of future emissions pathways or other climate mitigation action due the warming
    of the ocean that has *already* occurred due to climate change[³](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/hazards/sealevelrise/sealevelrise-tech-report-sections.html).

    While residential assets in general have been battered by a slew of extreme weather
    events in recent years, e.g., hurricanes, wildfires etc., for these coastal residents,
    another significant emerging risk is flooding and property loss due to accelerated
    sea level rise (SLR). However, in the exploratory research for this project, it
    was found that there may not yet be a deep understanding of the full extend of
    potential SLR impacts. Therefore, this project intends to bring awareness to regions
    expected to be impacted in the medium term (2050) and longer term (2100) in various
    scenarios of accelerated sea level rise.

    sea levels are currently rising at a *significantly accelerated pace* compared
    to previously observed levels in the 20th century: sea levels along the contiguous
    US coastline are expected to rise, on average, as much over the next 30 years

    project has been designed as a scenario based qualitative stress test. SLR scenarios
    have been designed based on the principles utilized in the Federal Reserve Capital
    Stress Testing exercise[⁴](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2023-Stress-Test-Scenarios.htm);
    one baseline scenario and two “plausible but severe” scenarios of SLR have been

    US may be impacted at various SLR levels over the longer term.

    In particular, three NOAA SLR long term levels are considered in this project:
    Low (0.6m or approxiamtely 2ft), Intermediate (1.2m or approxiamtely 4ft) and
    High (2.2m or approxiamtely 7ft); these projected SLR levels have been mapped

    approximately 2ft. This low projection is expected to materialize even at low
    emission levels with >92% certainity at all levels of global temperature rise[3](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/hazards/sealevelrise/sealevelrise-tech-report-sections.html).
    The Adverse and Severely Advserse Scenarios are meant to be “plausible but severe”.
    NOAA’s low term “Intermediate” SLR of approximately 4ft and “High” SLR of approximately
    7ft, have been considered for the Advserse and Severely Adverse scenarios respectively.
    These high SLRs are associated with higher green house gas emissions and corresponding
    larger increases in global temperatures compared to pre-industrial levels. Extreme
    scenarios of SLR greater than 2.5m (approximately 8ft) are no longer considered
    plausible by 2100[³](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/hazards/sealevelrise/sealevelrise-tech-report-sections.html)
    and so the maximum SLR level considered in this project is the “plausible but
    severe” NOAA High SLR of 7feet for the Severely Adverse Scenario.

- en: In addition to long term SLR impacts, this project also analyzes census tracts
    expected to be impacted by SLR over the medium term (2050). Over the medium term,
    SLR is bound on the lower end by 1ft and on the higher end by 2ft for the contiguous
    US. Recent scientific developments have led to an improved understanding of the
    factors driving SLR and therefore, there is a lot more confidence in this narrower
    range (irrespective of the future course of emission pathways)[³](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/hazards/sealevelrise/sealevelrise-tech-report-sections.html).
    Due to this increase confidence in the SLR predictions over the medium term, this
    project does not use a scenario based approach for the medium term. Instead, all
    contiguous US coastal census tracts at risk for SLR of 1ft by 2050 are considered
    at risk over the medium term in this project.
