    regardless of field or industry: having to navigate professional relationships
    and communicate with people who might not always be on the same page as you. And
    you have to do that within the constraints of goals, available resources, and
    limited time—and on top of everything else you might need to deal with in your
    life.'

    across professions and workplace types, but even within well-defined roles and
    disciplines. That certainly appears to be the case for data and ML professionals,
    who despite a very broad range of skills and responsibilities, often have to resolve
    similar issues.

    data science work and career challenges we see pop up again and again; they’re
    grounded in the authors’ personal experiences, but offer insights that can likely
    help a wide swath of our community. Enjoy!

    familiar? This conundrum is by no means unique to data science, but it does play
    out in specific ways in this profession, and [Jimmy Wong](https://medium.com/u/c422a0d17d5f?source=post_page---user_mention--4930e77efe22--------------------------------)’s
