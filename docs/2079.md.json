Can you do that this turn?? If so lay \n  your strategy out accordingly.\n\n  **Objective:**\n\n  Your goal is to win the game by one of the victory conditions given\n  in the rules. Focus on decisive attacks that reduce \n  your opponents' ability to fight back. When possible, eliminate \n  opponents to gain their cards, which will allow you to trade them \n  in for more troops and accelerate your conquest.\n\n  **Strategic Considerations:**\n\n  1\\. **Attack Strategy:**\n  - Identify the most advantageous territories to attack.\n  - Prioritize attacks that will help you secure continent bonuses or \n  weaken your strongest opponents.\n  - Look for opportunities to eliminate other players. If an opponent \n  has few territories left, eliminating them could allow you to gain \n  their cards, which can be especially powerful if you’re playing with \n  progressive card bonuses.\n  - Weigh the risks of attacking versus the potential rewards.\n\n  2\\. **Defense Strategy:**\n  - Identify your most vulnerable territories and consider fortifying \n  them.\n  - Consider the potential moves of your opponents and plan your defense \n  accordingly.\n\n  Multi-Turn Planning: Think about how you can win the game within \n  the next 2-3 turns. What moves will set you up for a decisive victory?\n  Don't just focus on this turn; consider how your actions this turn \n  will help you dominate in the next few turns.\n\n  **Instructions:**\n\n  - **Limit your response to a maximum of 300 words.**\n  - **Be concise and direct. Avoid unnecessary elaboration.**\n  - **Provide your strategy in two bullet points, each with a \n  maximum of four sentences.**\n\n  **Output Format:**\n\n  Provide a high-level strategy for your turn, including:\n  1\\. **Attack Strategy:** Which territories will you target, and why? \n  How many troops will you commit to each attack? If you plan to \n  eliminate an opponent, explain how you will accomplish this.\n  2\\. **Defense Strategy:** Which territories will you fortify, and \n  how will you allocate your remaining troops?\n\n  Example Strategy:\n  - **Attack Strategy:** Attack {Territory B} from {Territory C} with \n  10 troops to weaken Player 1 and prevent them from securing the \n  continent bonus for {Continent Y}. Eliminate Player 2 by attacking \n  their last remaining territory, {Territory D}, to gain their cards.\n  - **Defense Strategy:** Fortify {Territory E} with 3 troops to \n  protect against a potential counter-attack from Player 3.\n\n  Remember, your goal is to make the best strategic decisions that\n      will maximize your chances of winning the game. Consider the \n      potential moves of your opponents and how you can position \n      yourself to counter them effectively.\n\n  What is your strategy for this turn?\n        \"\"\"\n```", "```py\nfrom scipy.stats import chisquare\n\n# Observed wins for the three models\nobserved = [5, 3, 2]\n\n# Expected wins under the null hypothesis (equal probability)\nexpected = [10 / 3] * 3\n\n# Perform the chi-square goodness-of-fit test\nchi2_statistic, p_value = chisquare(f_obs=observed, f_exp=expected)\n\nchi2_statistic, p_value\n\n(1.4, 0.4965853037914095)\n```", "```py\nfrom scipy.stats import chisquare\n\n# Observed wins for the three models\nobserved = [7, 3, 0]\n\n# total observations\ntotal_observations = sum(observed)\n\n# Expected wins under the null hypothesis (equal probability)\nexpected_probabilites = [1/3] * 3\n\nexpeceted_wins = [total_observations * p for p in expected_probabilities]\n\n# Perform the chi-square goodness-of-fit test\nchi2_statistic, p_value = chisquare(f_obs=observed, f_exp=expected_wins)\n\nchi2_statistic, p_value\n\n(7.4, 0.0247235265)\n```", "```py\nfrom scipy.stats import chisquare\n\n# Observed wins for the three models\nobserved = [7, 3, 0]\n\n# Expected wins under the null hypothesis (equal probability)\nexpected_wins = [0.45 * 10, 0.45 * 10, 0.1 * 10] \n\n# Perform the chi-square goodness-of-fit test\nchi2_statistic, p_value = chisquare(f_obs=observed, \n  f_exp=expected_wins)\n\nchi2_statistic, p_value\n\n(2.8888888888888890, .23587708298570023)\n```", "```py\nRate Limit Error: Rate limit reached for model `llama-3.1-70b-versatile` \nin organization `org_01j440c04tfr3aas7qctr0ejtk` \non : Limit 1000000, Used 999496, Requested 1573\\. \nPlease try again in 1m32.2828s. \nVisit https://console.groq.com/docs/rate-limits for more information.\n```", "```py\n'''Your response should be in the following format:\n    Move:|||Territory, Number of troops|||\n    Reasoning:+++Reasoning for move+++p\n\nFor example:\n    Move:|||Brazil, 1|||\n    Reasoning:+++Brazil is a key territory in South America.+++''' \n```"]
