- en: In this article, we will develop a crater detection algorithm (CDA) for an autonomous
    crater-based optical navigation system for spacecraft in orbit of the Moon. The
    aim of an autonomous crater-based optical navigation system is to estimate spacecraft
    position and attitude from observed crater rims on the surface of a cratered celestial
    body.

- en: The use of optical navigation systems in spacecraft is well-established [1].
    Star trackers, a type of optical navigation instrument, have been deployed outside
    the Earth’s atmosphere from as early as 1959 [2]. Star trackers determine spacecraft
    attitude by capturing images of the surrounding star field, identifying known
    stars within those images and comparing the positions of these stars with a catalogue
    of celestial objects — with this data the precise attitude of the spacecraft can
    be determined.

- en: Ground-based systems currently used in guidance, navigation and control (GNC)
    of spacecraft in lunar orbit are becoming overtaxed. Demand for these ground-based
    systems will continue to grow as the number of spacecraft in orbit of the Moon
    increases. With an increased focus on a return to the Moon by…
