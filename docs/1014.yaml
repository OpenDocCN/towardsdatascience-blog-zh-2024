    Language Models (LLMs) like Gemini, GPT, or Claude. In parallel to all this core
    AI progress, there is also a lot of discovery and work from many other companies
    on how to actually leverage these models to innovate, bring further value, and
    reduce costs. It is easy to feel overwhelmed and pressured to keep up with all
    this progress, I can say it happens to me a lot! In this blog post, I’m packing
    some of the most important concepts and their potential to products and companies
    to help you keep up.

    integration of LLMs and other GenAI models into their products or processes. These
    concepts are: prompting, fine-tuning, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and
    agents. I’m sure you’ll have heard about several or all of these concepts before,
    but I feel sometimes the differences between the concepts are unclear, and most
    importantly we are still unaware of the potential they can provide to our companies
    or products.'
