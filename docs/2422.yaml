    Of course, there can be dozens of reasons why your Power BI report performs slow,
    but in this post, I want to share with you the “low-hanging fruit” and how you
    can significantly improve Power BI semantic models by applying some very simple
    optimization techniques.

    performed by a customer support department of the fictitious company Customer
    First. This table includes approximately 9 million rows, which is not considered
    a large table in the context of Power BI and analytical workloads. For the sake
    of simplicity, let’s pretend that our model consists of only this single table.
    Finally, a semantic model is configured as an Import mode model. If you want to
    learn how your data is stored in Power BI, I suggest you start by reading [this
    article](https://data-mozart.com/vertipaq-brain-muscles-behind-power-bi/) first.
