- en: A RAG system is an innovative approach to information retrieval. It utilizes
    traditional information retrieval approaches like vector similarity search combined
    with state-of-the-art large language model technology. Combined, these technologies
    make up a robust system that can access vast amounts of information from a simple
    prompt.

    mail. I typically have some information about the mail, like who the correspondent
    was or vaguely what the topic of the email was. Still, I must be more specific
    when doing a direct word search in Gmail, which makes finding the specific mail
    I am looking for challenging. I would like to have a RAG system that allows me
    to prompt my emails to search for them. So, if I needed an old email from my university
    about a subject, I could prompt something like "What technical course did I enroll
    in during my second year at NTNU?". An equivalent direct word search to this prompt
    is challenging since I need more specific information in my prompt. Instead, a
    RAG system could find the mail, given it has all…
