- en: My boss asked me this question two years ago. At the time I was a senior data
    scientist. I was successfully leading projects and mentoring junior team members
    on top of other duties. Since I was already doing a lot of the work of a manager
    (or so I thought), I didn’t think moving to a management position would be a big
    change. Plus, I thought a “fancier” title and a pay bump for (mostly) the same
    work sounded like a good deal, so, even though I never planned on trying to become
    a manager, I eventually agreed to move from an individual contributor (senior
    data scientist) to a people leader role (manager data science).

    contributor role. I will share what motivated me to do this later on in this post,
    but in short, I found that an individual contributor role aligns with my interests…
