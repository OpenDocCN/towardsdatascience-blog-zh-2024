    Traditionally, among practitioners there is a certain mistrust in outliers, this
    is why ad-hoc measures such as removing them from the dataset are often adopted.

    **Sometimes, they are even more important than other observations!** Take for
    instance the case of individuals that are outliers because they are very high-paying
    customers: you don’t want to discard them, actually, you probably want to treat
    them with extra care.'

    with ML models. My feeling is that data scientists believe that outliers harm
    the performance of their models. But this belief is probably based on a preconception
    more than on real evidence.
