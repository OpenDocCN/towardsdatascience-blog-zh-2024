    data space is hard. There are hundreds, if not thousands of ways to [skin this

- en: About 20 years ago, applications lived on computers owned by the companies that
    needed them — this is called “on-premise”. Owning these computers is an architectural
    decision. Consequently, cloud software vendors did not exist, since there was
    no demand for cloud software due to its inherent incompatibility with the architecture
    of the time.

    However, some of us are still running our own servers. Others have hybrid models.
    This means understanding the impact your architecture has on the solutions you
    choose is more important than ever, and in this article we’ll dive into how a
    microservices vs. monolithic approach to data architecture impacts the tools you
    buy.
