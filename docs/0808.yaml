- en: What data science and software engineering have in common is writing code. But
    while code is the main outcome of software engineering, data science projects
    typically end with models, results, and reports. Consequently, in data science
    the quality, structure, and delivery of code is often an afterthought at best.

    at the end can be trusted.

    you would be able to obtain the same results, *regardless of how much time has
    passed since you first performed the analysis*.

    is that component you developed represents the best possible performance given
    what is reasonably possible within the requirements of the product.

    difficult.
