Initialize:\n   - Set the peeling parameter (usually 0.05)\n   - Set the initial box (segment) to encompass the entire data space.\n   - Define the target quality function (e.g., a potential churn reduction).\n\n2\\. While the stopping criterion is not met:\n   - For each dimension of the data space:\n     * Identify a small portion (defined by a peeling parameter) \n       of the data to remove that maximizes quality of remaining data\n   - Update the box by removing the identified portion from \n     the current box.\n   - Update the dataset by removing the data points that fall outside \n     the new box.\n\n3\\. End when the stopping criterion is met \n   (e.g., after a certain number of iterations \n   or minimum number of data points remaining).\n\n4\\. Return the final box and all the preceding boxes as candidate segments.\n```"]
