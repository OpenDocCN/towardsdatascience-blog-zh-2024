    variable hunting! Discover how to quickly identify and extract the variables you
    need from multiple SAS files using two simple R functions. Streamline your workflow,
    save time, and make data preparation a breeze!

    I’ve often been handed folders full of datasets. For example, imagine opening
    a folder containing 56 SAS files, each with unique data (example below). If you’ve
    been in this situation, you know the frustration: trying to locate a specific
    variable in a sea of files feels like looking for a needle in a haystack.'

    variables of interest are. But often, you don’t. While a data dictionary is usually
    provided, it’s frequently a PDF document that lists variables across multiple
    pages. Finding what you need might involve searching (Ctrl+F) for a variable on
    page 100, only to realize the dataset’s name is listed on page 10\. Scrolling
    back and forth wastes time.

    to read all datasets in a folder, generate a consolidated dataframe of variable
    names and their labels (example below), and identify where each variable is located.
    This approach has made my work faster and more efficient. Here’s how you can do
    it, step by step.

    of this post). This function requires the folder path where all your datasets

    you need. Filter the `variable_name` or `variable_label` columns to locate relevant
    terms. For example, if you’re looking for gender-related variables, they might
    be labeled as sex, gender, is_male, or is_female.

    to identify the original datasets (`file_name`) containing them. If a variable
    appears in multiple datasets (e.g., `ID`), you’ll need to identify which dataset
    includes all the variables you’re interested in.

    you will filter `names_labels` to keep only the original dataset with both variables
    (e.g., `ID` and `VAR1_A`). In our case, the `names_labels` dataframe will be reduced
    to only two rows, one for each of the two variables we were looking for, both
    of which will be found in the same original dataset.

    of the original dataset containing the variables of interest. This function creates
    a new dataframe in your R environment with only the selected variables. For example,
    if your variables are in `ABC.sas7bdat`, the function will create a new dataframe
    called `ABC` with just those variables.

    new dataframe(s) you need. For example, if your variables of interest came from
    `ABC.sas7bdat`, you’ll keep the filtered dataframe `ABC` which was the output
    of the `read_and_select` function.

    `DEF`), you can merge them. Use a unique identifier, such as `ID`, to combine
    the datasets into a single dataframe. The result will be a unified dataframe with
    all the variables you need. You will get a `df` dataframe with all the observations
    and only the variables you needed.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This approach saves time and organizes your work into a single, reproducible
    script. If you later decide to add more variables, simply revisit `steps 2 and
    3`, update your list, and rerun the script. This flexibility is invaluable when
    dealing with large datasets. While you’ll still need to consult documentation
    to understand variable definitions and data collection methods, this workflow
    reduces the effort required to locate and prepare your data. Handling multiple
    datasets doesn’t have to be overwhelming. By leveraging my custom functions like
    `get_names_labels` and `read_and_select`, you can streamline your workflow for
    data preparation.
