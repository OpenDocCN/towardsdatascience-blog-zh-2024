- en: Hybrid search in the context of RAG and vector database means searching chunks
    of documents that can help answer a question using both a semantic search based
    on embeddings and a full text search on the content of those chunks.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While hybrid search should give better results than a pure semantic approach
    as it should gives more relevant chunks of text by highlighting those that contains
    some keywords present in the research, there is still room for improvement.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As keywords are search in the same text that was used to calculate the embedding,
    what happen when a *chunk A* of a document contains the keywords while another
    *chunk B* of the same document is semantically close to the query and so should
    help to answer it?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We would like to have *chunk B* to be part of the documents returned by the
    retriever, but with a standard hybrid search that might not be the case.
