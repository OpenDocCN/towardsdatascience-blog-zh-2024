    quite a journey. Over the 11 months between January and November, I had 107 career-related
    conversations and applied to 80 positions, resulting in 2 offers (I took a ‚Äúbreak‚Äù
    in May to defend my PhD üòÖ). Some applications were stretches, sure, but many of
    them were posts to which I thought I‚Äôd be a great match ‚Äî or at least worth a
    conversation!

    like most of my cover letters were quite earnest and my resume had unique experiences,
    prompting me to second guess my communication skills. Is my resume not clear?
    Cover letter too wordy? Am I misrepresenting my skills? Am I not actually good
    enough for any of these positions?? It was certainly a disheartening time ‚Äî a
    feast for the impostor syndrome goblins lurking in the corners of my mind.

    any sort of feedback. Which parts can I improve for my next application to a job
    for which I think I am definitely a strong candidate? Many kind souls offered
    helpful suggestions on my materials, which I do think got better over time, but
    it‚Äôs hard to say what actually made a difference in the end. Maybe I finally started
    submitting strong/competitive applications after months of weaker attempts? Maybe
    2023 was a particularly rough year? Maybe I got unlucky with factors out of my
    control, like hitting fake job ads simply posted to ‚Äúdrum up interest‚Äù in a company,
    or ones pre-destined for an internal hire?

    Contact‚Äù ‚Äî sometimes this was someone who knew me well and could refer me, but
    often it was someone who I had met once (for coffee, a zoom chat, at a networking
    event). They didn‚Äôt necessarily know my specific skills super well, but they knew
    I was a real human, hopefully thought I was friendly/thoughtful, and could potentially
    relay a message to another real human to at least look for my application in the
    pile.

    like an S&P 500 upswing after some lows in late 2022 roughly coincides with the
    steeper slope of my job applications (perhaps when more positions were being posted?)
    and a corresponding uptick in interviews üëÄ Notably, this came after a series of
    big tech layoffs (>10,000 people) in early 2023 near some S&P 500 local minima.

    Though working towards climate solutions is where my heart is, I initially convinced

    experience and skills. Accordingly, in early 2023, we see I focused more on conversations
