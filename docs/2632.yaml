    all the cities and travel locations of the world. This dataset might be used to
    make travel suggestions or plan trips for users. You know this information exists
    in Wikipedia and is constantly updated thanks to community effort, but it’s all
    plain text or semi-structured in a way that does not fit your need.

    format, is one of the primary challenges that data scientists and machine learning
    engineers face when solving business problems. This post is an attempt at turning
    large text corpora into usable, relevant and structured data.

    of the zero-shot abilities of LLMs to build a text-to-structured-dataset pipeline.
    Multiple approaches exist, but we will explore an agent-based approach to perform
    JSON-like structured information parsing. This involves parsing complex information
    containing multiple, potentially linked entity types into a structured format.
