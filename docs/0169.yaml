- en: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense capabilities in natural
    language processing. They can generate remarkably human-like text, hold conversations,
    summarize long passages, and even attempt rudimentary reasoning.

- en: However, despite their exceptional advances in semantic understanding of text,
    LLMs still face profound limitations when complex logical reasoning is required.
    Their comprehension remains surface-level, often missing deeper connections or
    failing at deductions requiring mathematical logic.

- en: Two domains that expose these LLM reasoning deficiencies are tabular data and
    knowledge graphs. Tables containing structured statistics, relations, and properties
    abound in business analysis, science, and public policy contexts. Knowledge graphs
    assemble concepts, real-world entities, and their interrelations in intricate
    networks of facts modeled as graph nodes and edges.

- en: Reasoning with such structured data requires subtly balancing context with symbolic
    logic. For example, identifying statistical insights within tables benefits from
    understanding the semantics to contextualize what the numbers signify. Or solving
    analytical graph queries relies on manipulating logical graph patterns while tracking
    real-world entities.
