    for showcasing data visualization applications and, to ensure a consistent look,
    it wants to adopt a single graphing library to be used across all applications.
    And, let’s say, your job is to investigate which is most appropriate.

    data visualizations: Altair, Bokeh, Plotly, Pyplot (Matplotlib) and Vega Lite.
    And Streamlit provides some native charts, as well.'

    and from that data we will create a line chart showing the change in closing prices
    over a year for both currencies, a grouped bar chart showing the same data, again,
    for both currencies and a scatter chart with a trendline showing the correlation
    between the change in value of the two currencies.
