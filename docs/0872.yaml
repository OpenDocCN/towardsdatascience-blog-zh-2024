    through generations. It shows its age, its clarity and lustre long gone, with
    some chips scattered across the surface.

    in one way or the other, at least in the short-term. It often shows you events
    far into the future, but how much can you trust it really?

- en: The crystal ball I’m talking about here is of course our time series models,
    which we’ve built following the same approach underlying Meta’s Prophet suite.
    I’ve cheekily referred to my implementation as the False Prophet, but it looks
    like it’s anything but, producing what look to be fairly accurate forecasts (and
    I’ve got the cross-validation results to prove it).

    to struggle a bit at the extremes and edges; in this context, the extremities
    being forecasts far out into time.
