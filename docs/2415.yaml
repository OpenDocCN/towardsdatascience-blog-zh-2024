    book “[Why We Sleep](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Why-We-Sleep-Science-Dreams/dp/0141983760)”
    by Matthew Walker. Health books didn’t just casually fall into no.1 place on the
    Sunday Times Bestseller list. So, how did “Why We Sleep” achieve such a remarkable
    feat? If you’ve read the book, like I did, you will know exactly why. It is a
    powerful, bordering on frightening, piece of non-fiction with the central message:
    **if you don’t take your sleep seriously, you will suffer a world of health issues**.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s not just the message that’s powerful. The book contains an abundance of
    academic research and data analysis, all of which unequivocally supports the narrative.
    By the end of the book, there is no doubt about it — the message is true, and
    we, the enlightened few, then go out to tell everyone else they should read it
    too. The end result for the publisher is 10s of millions of dollars in revenue.
    I’m sure Penguin gave Matthew Walker a big pat on the back, and a few million
    for himself, naturally.
  prefs: []

    course, omit unwanted data. There is no mention of research that goes against
    the idea that less sleep doesn’t make a difference, or could even be good for
    you. But, what is truly impressive is that there are no unwanted data points for
    analyses that are actually used in the book!

    duration, a chart is shown, on page 129 of the book, presenting the results of
    a research paper. In it we have 4 four data points, 6hr = 72%, 7hr = 60%, 8hr
    = 34%, 9hr = 18%. The underlying data that built this chart comes from [research](https://journals.lww.com/pedorthopaedics/fulltext/2014/03000/chronic_lack_of_sleep_is_associated_with_increased.1.aspx)
    published in the Journal of Paediatric Orthopaedics, titled “Chronic lack of sleep
    is associated with increased sports injuries in adolescent athletes”. The paper’s
    data is exactly the same, except for the fact that there is an additional data
    point. It has data for athletes with five hours average sleep, which had an injury
    risk of 54%.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why might this data point have been omitted from Matthew Walker’s chart? It’s
    in a peer reviewed journal, so it’s not as if the five hours data point isn’t
    usable data. Of course, the answer is that it goes against the narrative. It’s
    much better to have a chart that goes from lowest sleep = worst to most sleep
    = best. Next time, when you have a pesky data point or two, remember, you can
    just remove it. If it’s acceptable enough for a Penguin published book by an author
    who is a UC Berkeley professor, then it’s acceptable enough for us.

    effect is a much sharper difference between data points, which translates to a
    feeling of significance. Of course, if the direction between data points goes
    against your narrative, you will want to set the Y-axis as low as possible, as
    to convey a feeling of insignificance in difference.

    most people, the color red is associated with something bad. Presenting a chart
    with a wall of red can be very effective in providing a sense of fear, crisis,
    alarm etc. to the audience. Climate change is a particularly great topic to use
    red as it’s also used to symbolize heat and fire.

    the same. Omitting data is simply removing the unwanted data from view, selective
    categorization is about shuffling data around until we find an adequate story.
    It is also less susceptible to criticism, and as such is most commonly used in

    by John Lott and David Mustard titled, “Crime, Deterrence, and Right‐to‐Carry
    Concealed Handguns” provides a remarkable chart of the consequences of implementing
    handgun concealment laws designed to increase the number of guns on the street.

    is quite remarkable. It would suggest that violent crimes are almost universally
    due to the lack of concealed handguns, as evident by the lack of variance i.e.
    the crime rate smoothly declines post introduction of handgun laws. So, how did
    the authors achieve such a remarkable chart?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Firstly, it takes advantage of technique number two, exploit pattern psychology,
    by starting the Y-axis at greater than zero. Secondly, and most influentially,
    it has selectively chosen what is and isn’t considered as a ‘violent crime’, ‘concealed
    handgun law’, and the ‘population’ of the study. For example, in the violent crime
    category, they choose to allow robbery and aggravated assaults with a gun, but
    not without a gun e.g. a knife. Why? Because, robberies and aggravated assaults
    on average increased post adoption of handgun laws, which goes against the narrative.
    But taking a small slice of this violent crime i.e. robberies and aggravated assaults
    with a gun, the average conveniently decreased post adoption of handgun laws.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similarly, some regions and years were excluded from the population sample.
    These regions and years had huge spikes in violent crimes post concealed handgun
    law adoption. The reason the authors gave for removing these populations was due
    to ‘higher drug prices’ (I’m not making this up, page 24 “[Crime, Deterrence,
    and Right‐to‐Carry Concealed Handguns](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/467988?seq=34)”).
