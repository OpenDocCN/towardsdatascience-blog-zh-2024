    financial statements, technical manuals, and market analysis reports, usually
    contain multimodal data (text as well as visual content such as graphs, charts,
    maps, photos, infographics, diagrams, and blueprints, etc.). Finding the right
    information from these documents requires a semantic search of text and related
    images for a given query posed by a customer or a company employee. For instance,
    a company’s product might be described through its title, textual description,
    and images. Similarly, a project proposal might include a combination of text,
    charts illustrating budget allocations, maps showing geographical coverage, and
    photos of past projects.

- en: Accurate and quick search of multimodal information is important for improving
    business productivity. Business data is often spread across various sources in
    text and image formats, making it challenging to retrieve all relevant information
    efficiently. While generative AI methods, particularly those leveraging LLMs for
    enhanced knowledge management in business (e.g., [retrieval augment generation](https://cloud.google.com/use-cases/retrieval-augmented-generation?hl=en),
    [graph RAGs](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/), among others), face limitations
    in accessing multimodal, scattered data. Methods that unify different data types
    allow users to query diverse formats with natural language prompts…
