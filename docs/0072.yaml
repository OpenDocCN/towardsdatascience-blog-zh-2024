    my work published in their [2023 AI report](https://www.kaggle.com/AI-Report-2023)
    and while I definitely don’t see myself as the perfect communicator, I thought
    I’d share some of the lessons that I believe helped me take that prize winning
    spot!

- en: I’m particularly proud of this achievement because in my experience one of the
    most important yet often overlooked things we do as data scientists is communicate
    and share our results.

    to talk about abstract concepts, using diagrams to convey patterns and finally
    overall structure. Hopefully, these tips and tricks might just work for you too
    next time you’re communicating or presenting!

- en: Sounds obvious right? but this one is especially tough — we go to university/college,
    or study courses to improve our craft and these courses introduce us to a range
    of technical concepts, each with a specific name that we grow to understand. Next,
    whenever we talk to other students we use this same language, and finally by the
    time we enter industry these technical terms are so ingrained in us we use them
    without thinking.

- en: Let me give you an example — in the area of tabular data, you might be fitting
    a model and trying to minimise one of the many acronym-based error metrics like
    Mean Average Prediction Error (MAPE). However quite often the people we’re communicating
    with will not understand these concepts at all. So what happens when we tell them
    all about how low we’ve gotten the MAPE in our latest forecasting model? They
    definitely won’t be impressed — At best they switch off — at worst they might
    feel uneasy wondering if they are supposed to know what the heck we’re talking
    about.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what’s the solution? The key is to communicate complex concepts in much simpler
    everyday terms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the example above of course we still want to highlight that our models are
    accurate, but we are much better of explaining this in plain English such as by
    saying we’ve improved the average percentage error. Even better still would be
    explaining it in the concept of what the model is trying to do. For example, if
    we’re predicting the weather we might say that we’ve reduced the 12 hour forecast
    in degrees Celsius down from 5% down to 1%.

- en: Let’s face it — a lot of the concepts in data science are pretty abstract. Ever
    tried to explain to your mum what it is you do all day? Yeah, me too, it never
    goes well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The good news is that most abstract concepts can be made clear by a tangible
    real world example. In the essay I attached I tried to make every point in the
    essay clear by using at least one example, and many times multiple examples. This
    is also true when trying to verbally explain concepts, and especially true when
    communicating with a less technical audience.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But which examples work best? The golden rule here is the more relevant an example
    is to the audience the better. For example, in my essay I constantly refer to
    Kaggle projects as examples, that’s because I know everybody that is reading the
    essay is on Kaggle and will be able to relate! If you were communicating the value
    of LLMs to teachers, maybe you’d talk about how they work in the context of summarising
    chapters of textbooks, or offering tailored writing feedback.

    is a great visual is one generated in a way that should make the intended pattern
    obvious.

- en: Take this simple example of an annotated table — it shows the type of models
    used in various winning solutions to simple tabular regression and classification
    competitions hosted on Kaggle. Even without understanding anything, our eyes will
    pick up on the pattern that there’s lot’s of check marks in the LightGBM and ensemble
    columns, so whatever those are, they sure are popular. This is a simple insight,
    but by arranging the data in just the right way it was obvious.

- en: I never liked writing essays at school — in fact, given who’s likely to read
    this, I will bet most of you didn’t either! But one lesson that’s stuck with me
    throughout the years was my high-school teachers simple essay structure — first
    you tell them, then you tell them, then you tell them again, that is, the introduction,
    body and conclusion all say the same thing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I didn’t really get it a the time but I have since seen the wisdom in it time
    and time again. If you jump right into a presentation then people won’t understand
    what they’re meant to be looking out for. Or if you forget to conclude the presentation
    people will likely only remember your last point! To avoid these pitfalls it’s
    almost always useful starting with your key points, elaborating on them, and then
    summarising them one last time, regardless of the medium — from essay to presentation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is especially true in data science as given the change of pace of the industry
    there’s always something new to be discussed, and chances are not everyone understands
    your niche like you do, so repetition helps carve out the main ideas.
