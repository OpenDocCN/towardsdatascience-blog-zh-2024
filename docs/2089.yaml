- en: Unlike a lot of data scientists in tech, my career in data science started in
    consulting, and I think it’s the best career move I have made. Say what you will
    about consulting culture and the hours, I learned so much in the two years I was
    at McKinsey and I still benefit from it every day.

- en: As a manager, part of my job is to coach data scientists on the team when it
    comes to projects and career growth in general. I realized what junior data scientists
    struggle with the most is usually not the technical/execution part of the job
    — that’s the easy to teach/easy to learn part.

    people don’t know how to navigate — things like how to break down an abstract
    business problem into smaller, clearly defined analyses that can eventually lead
    to concrete business impact.
