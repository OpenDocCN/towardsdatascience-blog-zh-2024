    than starting with my own story? I made *the* transition that many want to, and
    landed a job in data science coming from a non-technical background (no STEM degree,
    no social science degree). It wasn’t very straightforward: I moved in a zig-zag
    fashion, so try to bear with me.'

    than basketball. **I was studying English Literature only because my English was
    better than my peers’ back in the day, and I was able to get into a university
    with it.** Anyway, during the semester break of that year I went to Lebanon, Beirut
    for human biomechanics training (during those days I was training basketball players
    ). While I was there, the effect of prolonged stress was mentioned a couple of
    times and it sounded interesting. When I came back home, I wanted to explore more
    and watched Dr. Robert Sapolsky’s TED Talk titled [*The Biology of Our Best and
    Worst Selves*](https://youtu.be/ORthzIOEf30?si=_b2pNgN-JvPm35UA)*.* I was so impressed,
    I remember going like *“I wonder how he (Sapolsky) sees the world*.” Luckily,
    he had his whole class on Stanford’s YouTube[: Human Behavioral Biology.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL848F2368C90DDC3D)
    Well, I couldn’t keep up with it due to my lack of background (didn’t know anything
    related to science back then, this includes biology and/or neurobiology/psychology).
    I decided to visit the psychology department.'

    again which I can’t seem to remember now but it was related to evolution of belief
    systems. I went in by the first door that I found and met with [Dr. Bahcekapili](https://www.moralintuitionslab.com/member-affiliates/hasan-g.-bahçekapılı)
    and he told me to introduce myself to his colleague (his student then) next door,
    [Dr. Yilmaz.](https://www.moralintuitionslab.com/leaders) From then on, my interests
    shifted towards his: Intersection between morality, politics, religion, and decision
    making. I started to take his social psychology class unofficially and started
    to stop by his door more often to ask about things that I read: [behavioral biology](https://www.amazon.com/Behave-Biology-Humans-Best-Worst/dp/1594205078)
    to [social psychology](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/social-psychology/P200000006448),
    and [evolutionary psychology](https://www.amazon.com/Evolutionary-Psychology-New-Science-Mind/dp/0205992129).
    At one point, he asked me to be part of the lab that he was about to found and
    I said yes, ended up in [MINT Lab.](https://www.moralintuitionslab.com)'

    to be sure that I was not missing important findings in the field. It was enjoyable
    because the information was presented in a very graspable way. But with the lab,
    once we started reading research papers, I realized I don’t know anything about
    statistics hence I was not able to evaluate how convincing the research in front
    of me is. Being a literature student, I had to find something that assumed zero
    prior knowledge. I tried many books but [*OpenIntro Statistics*](https://www.openintro.org/book/stat/)
    and [*Learning Stats with JASP*](https://tomfaulkenberry.github.io/JASPbook/index.html)
    helped me a ton and they were enough for an undergraduate level. I started to
    realize how much I enjoy studying statistics and wanted to improve myself on the
    matter, wondered if mathematics could help with statistics.

    card games): Dr. Basar Coskunoglu. I started studying mathematics with him. He
    was patient enough to start from very basics (I didn’t know anything, literally,
    so we had to start from functions, inequality systems etc.) with me. We made it
    all the way to the calculus and linear algebra. We finished at a point where it
    was possible for me to go through books by myself, which was what I wanted in
    the first place. To this day, I still study linear algebra from different sources
    (mainly from my notes, [*Mathematics for Machine Learning*](https://mml-book.github.io/)
    and [Gilbert Strang’s books](https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Gilbert-Strang-Algebra/s?rh=n%3A13899%2Cp_lbr_one_browse-bin%3AGilbert+Strang))
    almost weekly since I enjoy it very much.'

    such as JASP, Jamovi, SPSS. R programming is also used but during those times
    I started to lose a bit interest in academia due to different reasons. So, I wanted
    to learn Python. I attended a boot camp (*I strongly advice against any data science
    boot camp now,* every piece of material they provide is available online and probably
    in a better way) which mainly helped me with programming skills along with industry-based
    cases rather than theoretical part since I was already done with the classic (up
    to deep learning): [*Introduction to Statistical Learning (Python version is available
    now).*](https://www.statlearning.com/)'

    (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey) for taking a part
    in a research project but it was coming to an end. So, timing was really nice
    to try my chances outside the academia. I wanted a part-time job or a long-term
    internship since I was still at school and did not want to burn out. Anyway, I
    started doing data science projects and included them on my CV under the “projects”
    part. I applied to different jobs but during the interviews I realized that many
    did not have a data science team and it scared me a little since it was going
    to be my first job, I felt like I needed a group of people that have some experience.
    Although I wasn’t sure how I would fit in a bank, I applied to DenizBank’s long
    term internship and after some steps, I was accepted as a data science intern.

    mutual since they wanted to keep me (also, it makes sense to keep someone after
    6 months rather than hiring a new person). Everything went smoothly at school,
    and I graduated. Additionally, although I spent six months there coding etc.,
    it was still required for me to take the junior data scientist test which included
    SQL, Python/R and probability and statistics questions. I passed the exam and
    am currently working as Jr. Data Scientist at DenizBank.

    in my mind to do something close to basketball. I saw [Formula 1 (F1) analytics
    account](https://linktr.ee/fdataanalysis) that does F1 analyses, and it inspired
    me to do something similar with basketball data. You can follow my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yigitasik/)
