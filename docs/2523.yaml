    year’s award went to Prof. John Hopfield and Prof. Geoffrey Hinton. But it’s a
    bit different this time. Instead of the usual discoveries about the natural world,
    the prize was awarded for something a little more artificial:'

    and the [Boltzmann machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_machine).
    This may surprise some, as ML can seem far removed from physics. However, many
    early foundational ML concepts were inspired by physical systems.'

    advanced in generative AI (in text/image/video generations), and to remind us
    that the foundations of these modern models are rooted in physics. More specifically,
    Hopfield networks and Boltzmann machines can be thought of as some of the original
    generative models, borrowing physics principles from natural…
