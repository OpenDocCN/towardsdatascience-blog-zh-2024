    questions regarding data value creation are elaborated and answered, allowing
    the organization to take concrete actions to leverage data as an asset. However,
    in my experience, this is rarely the case, and there is often a lack of joint
    understanding in organizations, how the terms data, digital and technology differ
    and relate to each other.

    of digital solutions for either internal staff or external customers, IT strategies
    often focus on system landscape, applications and network infrastructure. Both

    nor IT strategy is — in its core — concerned with enabling an organization to
    become data-driven.

    are many definitions and interpretations. As a consequence, there does not seem
    to be *the one single true approach* for designing a data strategy. So where to
    start?

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    be used to develop (any kind of) strategy and apply this to data strategy design.
    For this, we use the “*Playing to Win*” (P2W) strategy framework [4], which originates
    from joint work of Alan G. Lafley, who was former CEO of P&G, and Roger Martin,
    who worked for Monitor Consulting when starting to develop the framework.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The approach became the standard strategy approach at P&G and has successfully
    been applied in many industries since. In addition, the P2W framework has constantly
    been complemented and refined by Roger through a series of Strategy Practitioner
    Insights [15,17].
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    known and applied and comes with an entire ecosystem of processes, templates and
    trainings that can be leveraged for designing your data strategy.

    a competitive edge, with no bullet-proof certainty that the choices will turn

    corporate transformation program to become data-driven without a clear *business

    the onion by conducting a series of interviews with relevant business and management

    as well as with regards to the management and usage of data in the organization.
    Once this is done, it is then important to create a consent amongst stakeholders
    about the problem to be addressed. If there is consent that data is mission critical

    data similar to a smart watch. A corporate strategy formulation for this company
    using the P2W framework can be found in [7].

    Data Strategy Choice Cascade. The cheat sheet provided can guide data strategy
    design teams to rapidly apply the framework for their strategy work. Consequently,
    when it comes to data strategy design, there is no need to re-invent the wheel,
    but you can stand on the shoulders of giants to ensure your data strategy becomes
    a success, allowing your company to win.
