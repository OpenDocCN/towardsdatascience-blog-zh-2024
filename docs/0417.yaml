- en: The specter of unobserved confounding (aka omitted variable bias) is a notorious
    problem in observational studies. In most observational studies, unless we can
    reasonably assume that treatment assignment is *as-if* random as in a natural
    experiment, we can never be truly certain that we controlled for all possible
    confounders in our model. As a result, our model estimates can be severely biased
    if we fail to control for an important confounder–and we wouldn’t even know it
    since the unobserved confounder is, well, unobserved!

    to possible sources of unobserved confounding. In other words, it is a helpful
    exercise to ask ourselves: how much unobserved confounding would there have to
    be for our estimates to drastically change (e.g., treatment effect no longer statistically
    significant)? Sensitivity analysis for unobserved confounding is an active area
    of research, and there are several approaches to tackling this problem. In this
    post, I will cover a simple linear method [[1]](https://academic.oup.com/jrsssb/article/82/1/39/7056023)

    to eliminate the spurious *D* effect since the statistically significant *D* effect
    disappears when we control for *Z*. What we haven’t discussed yet is exactly how
    strong *Z* is as a confounder. For this, we will utilize a useful statistical
    concept called partial *R²*, which quantifies the proportion of variation that
    a given variable of interest can explain that can’t already be explained by the
    existing variables in a model. In other words, partial *R²* tells us the *added*
    explanatory power of that variable of interest, above and beyond the other variables
    that are already in the model. Formally, it can be defined as follows

    and 20% of the variation in *D* that can’t be explained by observed variables.

    What the RV is telling us here is that, *even without any explicit knowledge of
    Z*, we can still reason that any unobserved confounder needs, on average, at least
    18% strength in the partial *R²* scale vis-à-vis both the treatment and the outcome
    to be able to nullify our statistically significant result.
  id: totrans-64

    is that it is designed to be a single number that *summarizes* the necessary strength
    of the confounder with both the outcome and the treatment, so 18% makes perfect
    sense given what we know about the data. You can think about it like this: since
    the method doesn’t have access to the actual numbers 16% and 20% when calculating
    the RV, it is doing its best to quantify the strength of the confounder by assigning
    18% to both partial *R²* values (*Y~Z|D,X* and *D~Z|X*), which isn’t too far off
    from the truth at all and actually does a great job summarizing the strength of
    the confounder.'

    our RV is correct, but seeing how the two results align here should at least give
    you some confidence in the method. Finally, once we calculate the RV, we should
    think about whether an unobserved confounder of that strength is plausible. In
    our case, the answer is ‘yes’ because we have access to the data generation process,
    but for your specific real-life application, the existence of such a strong confounder
    might be an unreasonable assumption. This would be good news for you since no
    realistic unobserved confounder could drastically change your results.

    with all of its bells and whistles as a Python package under the name [PySensemakr](https://github.com/nlapier2/PySensemakr)
    (R, Stata, and Shiny App versions exist as well). For example, to get the exact
    same result that we manually calculated in the previous section, we can simply
    run the following code chunk.
  id: totrans-68
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Note that “Robustness Value, q = 1 alpha = 0.05” is 0.184, which is exactly
    what we calculated above. In addition to the RV for statistical significance,
    the package also provides the RV that is needed for the coefficient estimate itself
    to shrink to 0\. Not surprisingly, unobserved confounding needs to be even larger
    for this to happen (0.233 vs 0.184).
  id: totrans-69
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The package also provides contour plots for the two partial *R²* values, which
    allows for an intuitive visual display of sensitivity to possible levels of confounding
    with the treatment and the outcome (in this case, it shouldn’t be surprising to
    see that the x/y-axis value pairs that meet the red dotted line include 0.18/0.18
    as well as 0.20/0.16).
  id: totrans-70
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    amounts of confounding. In our case, since we only have one observed covariate
    *X*, we can set our benchmarks to be 0.25x, 0.5x and 1x as strong as that observed
    covariate. The resulting plot tells us that a confounder that is half as strong
    as *X* should be enough to nullify our statistically significant result (since
    the “0.5x X” value falls right on the red dotted line).

    used a continuous treatment variable, in practice the method works for any kind
    of treatment variable including binary treatments. On the other hand, the outcome
    variable technically needs to be a continuous one since we are operating in the
    OLS framework. However, the method can still be used even with a binary outcome
    if we model it using OLS (this is called a LPM [[2]](https://murraylax.org/rtutorials/linearprob.html)).

    is a common danger in observational studies. Despite this potential danger, observational
    studies are a vital tool in data science because randomization simply isn’t feasible
