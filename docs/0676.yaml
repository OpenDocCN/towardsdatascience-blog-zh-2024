- en: Consciousness is a heavy quest that has puzzled philosophers for over two thousand
    years. Because of its subjectivity and elusiveness, it was not a subject for scientific
    study until recent decades. With the unprecedented advances of artificial intelligence
    (AI), in particular, the remarkable performance of large language models (LLM),
    understanding consciousness becomes pragmatic and pressing beyond the philosophical
    and academic debates — how can we tell if ChatGPT has consciousness, and how can
    humankind be prepared if “artificial” consciousness arises in the foreseeable
    future?

    the inner workings of consciousness in human brains based on vast experimental
    data, as triggered primarily by two factors.

    the activities of neural cell assemblies in awake-behaving primates and humans.
    These techniques include brain imaging technologies, neurophysiological recording
    of hundreds of neurons simultaneously, and neural network modeling propelled by
    AI.
