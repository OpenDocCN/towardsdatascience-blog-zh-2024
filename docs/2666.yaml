- en: Portable Document Format files (PDFs) have been floating around in the digital
    world since [their inception by Adobe](https://www.prepressure.com/pdf/basics/history)
    in the early 1990s. Designed to preserve formatting across different devices,
    PDFs quickly became the go-to format for sharing everything from contracts to
    annual reports and complex financial documents.

    a mainstay to this day. Anyone can open a PDF, and it always displays the same
    way, no matter what reader is being used. This is an advantage for files that
    should not change — unlike, say, editable word or PowerPoint files.

- en: One disadvantage of PDFs is that they are meant for human eyes. In other words,
    if you want to process a 400-page report, initially you might need to open it
    manually and at least scroll through to the relevant sections yourself. This is
    a problem when working with large volumes of data, stored in PDFs.

    not to mention energy-consuming. Even when you succeed, state-of-the-art chatbots
    give unreliable answers at best when queried about the contents. Fine-tuning such
    chatbots to the type…
