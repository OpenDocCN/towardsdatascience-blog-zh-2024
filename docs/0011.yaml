- en: The three most popular Python data types are the list, the dictionary, and the
    tuple. Lists and dictionaries are mutable, meaning that their elements can be
    altered after creation. Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable, so they cannot
    be changed after creation. If you do need to modify the contents of a tuple, you
    must create a new instance with the desired changes and assign it to the same
    variable.

- en: This article focuses on Python named tuples, a specialized type of tuple that
    combines the power of regular tuples with the added flexibility of named fields.
    Compared to regular tuples, named tuples can make code simpler, more readable
    and more maintainable — and even more Pythonic. However, you must be careful,
    as sometimes using named tuples excessively can inadvertently reduce code readability
    rather than enhance it.

    If you’re not familiar with them, I strongly advise you to first read the following
    two articles about this data type:'
