- en: If you’ve been reading some of my recent blogs, you know I’m a big user of the
    new AI tools that generate images from prompts, part of the recent AI spring (I
    pay a monthly fee to Midjourney for the privilege).

- en: A perception I’ve had about AI research is that it’s a race to hacking some
    complicated models until they make some benchmarks move without spending enough
    time understanding why the models do what they do. In this sense, research work
    in these models sometimes feels more like an art than a science. This is the reason
    I’ve had a minor revulsion towards digging too deep into them. This is exacerbated
    by the speed at which development seems to be happening. What if I spend a lot
    of effort understanding some new-fangled model that becomes obsolete tomorrow?

- en: But the recent advances in image generating models where one can just enter
    some description of an image and get a really high-quality piece in response (Midjourney,
    Dall-E and the open-source Stable Diffusion being some of the players) has forced
    me to come out of my cave and pay attention. [And attention was all I needed](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf).

    diffusion models is pretty deep, motivated by a branch of physics called statistical
    thermodynamics…
