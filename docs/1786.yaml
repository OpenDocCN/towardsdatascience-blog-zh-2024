- en: As someone who spent considerable time with various computer science topics,
    where mathematical abstractions can sometimes be very dry and abstract, I find
    the practical, hands-on nature of data science to be a breath of fresh air. It
    never fails to amaze me how even the simplest ideas can lead to fascinating results.

- en: I’ll never forget how the implementation of my Bachelor’s thesis went. While
    it was not about machine learning, it had a formative effect on me, and I’ll manage
    to constantly remind myself of it when tinkering with neural networks. It was
    an intense time because the thesis was about an analytical model of sound propagation
    that aimed to run in the browser, thus having very limited performance leading
    to long running simulations. It constantly failed to complete after running for
    many hours. But the worst experience was interpreting wrongly configured simulations
    with confusing results, which often made me think the whole model was nonsense.
