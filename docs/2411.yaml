    as 0.9\. The evaluation metrics like precision, recall and f1-score also appear
    promising. But your experience and intuition told you that something isn’t right
    so you did further investigation and found this:'

    in its target variable. Due to the evident ***imbalance*** between the majority
    and minority classes, the model excels at predicting its majority class `0` while
    the performance of the minority class `1` is far from satisfactory. However, because
    class `1` represents a very small portion of the target variable, its performance
    has little impact on the overall scores of these evaluation metrics, which gives
    you an illusion that the model is strong.

    imbalanced datasets in the real-world projects. *An* ***imbalanced dataset***
