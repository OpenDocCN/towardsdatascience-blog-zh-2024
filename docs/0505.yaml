    correlations dredged up from silly data” (Vigen, 2014) see: [Tyler Vigen’s personal
    website](https://www.tylervigen.com/), there have been many articles that pay
    tribute to the perils and pitfalls of this whimsical tendency to manipulate statistics
    to make correlation equal causation. See: HBR (2015), Medium (2016), FiveThirtyEight
    (2016). As data scientists, we are tasked with providing statistical analyses
    that either accept or reject null hypotheses. We are taught to be ethical in how
    we source data, extract it, preprocess it, and make statistical assumptions about
    it. And this is no small matter — global companies rely on the validity and accuracy
    of our analyses. It is just as important that our work be reproducible. Yet, in
    spite of all of the ‘good’ that we are taught to practice, there may be that ​one
    occasion (or more) where a boss or client will insist that you work the data until
    it supports the hypothesis and, above all, show how variable y causes variable
    x when correlated. This is the basis of p-hacking where you enter into a territory
    that is far from supported by ‘good’ practice. In this report, we learn how to
    conduct fallacious research using spurious correlations. We get to delve into
    ‘bad’ with the objective of learning what not to do when you are faced with that
    inevitable moment to deliver what the boss or client whispers in your ear.'

    from two different sources were preprocessed and merged together in order to produce
    visuals of relationships. Spurious correlations occur when two variables are misleadingly
    correlated, and it is further assumed that one variable directly affects the other
    variable so as to cause a certain outcome. ​The reason we chose this project idea
    is because we were interested in ways that manage a client’s expectations of what
    a data analysis project should produce. For team member Banks, sometimes she has
    had clients demonstrate displeasure with analysis results and actually on one
    occasion she was asked to go back and look at other data sources and opportunities
    to “help” arrive at the answers they were seeking. Yes, this is p-hacking — in
    this case, where the client insisted that causal relationships existed because
    they believe the correlations existed to cause an outcome.

    analysis was conducted. The datasets spanned different domains of economic and
    environmental factors that were collected and affirmed as being from public sources.
    The datasets contained variables with no apparent causal relationship but exhibited
    statistical correlation. The chosen datasets were of the Apple stock data, the
    primary, and daily high temperatures in New York City, the secondary. The datasets
    spanned the time period of January, 2017 through December, 2022.

    Capturing the data over a time period of five years gave a meaningful view of

    temperature and stock, there were troughs and peaks in data points. Note temperature
    was in Fahrenheit, a meteorological setting. We used astronomical setting to further
    manipulate our data to pose stronger spuriousness. While the data could be downloaded
    as csv or xls files, for this assignment, Python’s Beautiful soup web scraping

    Weather data contained date, daily high, daily low temperature, and Apple stock
    data contained date, opening price, closing price, volume, stock price, stock
    name. To merge the datasets, the date columns needed to be in datetime format.
    An inner join matched records and discarded non-matching. For Apple stock, date
    and daily closing price represented the columns of interest. For the weather,
    date and daily high temperature represented the columns of interest.

    using the summer season of 2018 temperatures in five U.S. cities, we pulled five
    years of daily high temperatures for New York City and Apple Stock performance
    from January, 2017 through December, 2022\. In conducting exploratory analysis,
    we saw weak correlations across the seasons and years. So, our next step was to
    convert the temperature. Instead of meteorological, we chose astronomical. This
    gave us ​‘meaningful’ correlations across seasons.

    The date fields were different where for weather, the date was month and day.
    For stock, the date was in year-month-day format. We addressed this by converting
    each dataset’s date column to datetime. Also, each date column was sorted either
    in chronological or reverse chronological order. This was resolved by sorting
    both date columns in ascending order.
