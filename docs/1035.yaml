- en: Let’s assume we want to buy a house. Before we do so, we want to verify that
    the advertised price of 400,000 € is reasonable. For this, we use a model that,
    based on the number of rooms, the size and the location of the house, predicts
    that the house is worth 500,232.12 €.
  prefs: []

- en: Should we buy this house? It seems like a good deal, doesn’t it? But would our
    decision be different if the model instead had predicted a price of 340,021.34
    €? Probably, right?

- en: Hence, should we trust the model when making the decision to buy this house?
    What is the probability that the house is worth exactly 500,232.12 € or 340,021.34
    €?

- en: As the probability is close to zero, we should rather see the prediction as
    a best guess of the true outcome. Moreover, there is a risk for us when making
    a decision based on the model.

    If a self-driving car does not classify a person crossing the street as an obstacle,
    the result might be deadly.
