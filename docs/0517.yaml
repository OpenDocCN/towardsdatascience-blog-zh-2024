    (at least I think that is the perception I give from my posts!). High pay, great
    benefits, flexible hours, and interesting work are some things that come to mind
    when thinking about a data science job.

    the scenes, and a data scientist is no exception. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a fantastic
    job, and I absolutely love the field, but not every day is completely glorious.

    you must accept as a data scientist and ones I face regularly. Hopefully, this
    will help anyone reading this post who wants to be a data scientist to decide
    if this field is really for them.
