    confronted with a pressing question that is forecasted to only become more urgent:
    What is the environmental cost of our progress? Training, hosting, and running
    these models aren’t just compute-intensive — they require substantial natural
    resources, leading to significant carbon and water footprints that often fly under
    the radar. This discussion has become even more timely with Google’s recent report
    on July 2, 2024, highlighting the challenges in meeting their ambitious climate
    goals. The report revealed a [13% increase](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/2024-environmental-report/)
    in emissions in 2023 compared to the previous year and a [48% rise](https://apnews.com/article/climate-google-environmental-report-greenhouse-gases-emissions-3ccf95b9125831d66e676e811ece8a18?ref=biztoc.com)
    compared to their baseline year of 2019\. The demand for AI has significantly
    strained data centers, a trend reflected in [Microsoft’s environmental sustainability
    report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/sustainability/report)
    from May, which noted a 29% increase in emissions above their 2020 baseline due
    to data center usage. Additionally, [the International Energy Agency predicts](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/6b2fd954-2017-408e-bf08-952fdd62118a/Electricity2024-Analysisandforecastto2026.pdf)
    that global data center and AI electricity demand could double by 2026, underscoring
    the urgent need for sustainable practices. For everyone…'
