    and of the same size. Both companies have their own sales team repeating daily
    a sales process for inbound leads, but they use a radically different sales strategy.

    recent leads, convinced that these **fresh contacts** are their best bet.

    armed with data-driven insights. They’ve invested in a **Predictive Lead Scoring**
    prioritization system that analyzes a variety of factors — from user profile to

- en: In today’s sales context, companies spend a lot of resources on SDRs or sales
    agents for initial outreach and lead qualification. They often lack precise methodologies
    to identify the most promising leads and simply work all of them without any prioritization.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most agents prioritize leads based on their own **human criteria**, which is
    often biased by personal and non-validated perspectives. Conversely, among the
    few that implement prioritization methods, the **predominant strategy is based
    on ‘fresh-contact’ criteria**, which is still very rudimentary.

    Lead Scoring systems across different sectors, I can state that companies that
    adopt these technologies **reduce operational costs by minimizing work on poorly
    qualified leads**, thereby improving their ROI significantly.

    solely on this element, it was viewed as an extra signal that may be considerably
    or more relevant depending on the lead profile.

  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    i.e., high probability of conversion puts them closest to making a purchase. It
    is understandable that they are more reactive and receptive to sales initiatives,
    with the influence of quick action being especially substantial.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the user. Responding quickly takes advantage of this high level of interest before
    it diminishes, as well as prevents the competition from stepping in.

    tiers: the top 30% (rating A or best leads), middle 40% (rating B or average leads),

    categorizing the probability output of the Predictive Lead Scoring tool.'

    conversion rate if not contacted within the first 3 hours, while the rest do not

    These high-value prospects not only have higher conversion rates and form the
    majority of sales, but they are also the most reactive to quick contact, further
    **evidencing the need for prioritization**.

    that should be seriously considered to boost sales, such as persistence, re-engagement,
