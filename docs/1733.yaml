    While sketching the architecture, I spent considerable time contemplating the
    choices for primary keys. This topic seems to resurface repeatedly, and upon reading
    other articles, I realised that it goes deeper than I had previously assumed.
    Although I am not entirely new to data design and its various pitfalls, I had
    never fully appreciated the profound impact of primary key selection on system
    performance and scalability. In this article, I want to share my thoughts on the
    choices I made and the reasoning behind them.

    in mind that some arguments may not be applicable outside of Postgres.

    which means there is already a significant amount of context for the participating
    entities. The following figure and assumptions provide a simplified snapshot of
    the mental model…
