    bus. Five minutes later, I realized that the bag was missing, but the bus had
    already left. After coming home, I checked the bus company’s website for the possibility
    of claiming the lost bag, and several days later, I was lucky enough to get it
    back. I live in Amsterdam, and public transport here has a partnership with an
    [iLost](https://ilost.co/nl/org/connexxion) company, where people can claim their
    lost property. This site has a pretty clear structure and does not even require
    registration to view items forgotten by different people (personal details are,
    obviously, hidden). Having a sort of data-oriented mindset, I got a “Eureka” moment
    — data of this kind can be great from the cultural anthropology perspective, and
    we can learn a lot about what kind of goods can be lost in public transport and
    other places. Alas, the iLost license agreement does not allow the use of the
    data without written consent, and nobody responded to my question. But still having
    this idea in mind, I started to search online for alternative sources, and it
