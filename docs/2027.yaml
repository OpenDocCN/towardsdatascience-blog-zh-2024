    of super-paws-ition. Quantum superposition is the principle where a quantum system
    can exist in multiple states simultaneously until it is measured, at which point
    it collapses into one of the possible states. (Image generated by DALLE-3)

- en: 'I’m really excited to share this article with you because it’s closely tied
    to my current research: optimizing project schedules with quantum computing. My
    passion for this topic comes from my background as a project manager and my ongoing
    research into how quantum computing can help solving complex optimization problems.
    During my PhD, I specifically looked into how today’s quantum technology could
    be used to tackle complex scheduling challenges, that are specific for the field
    of project management.'

- en: We’re living in an incredible era where quantum computers are no longer just
    a concept — they’re real and being used. Imagine what Richard Feynman would say
    about them! However, these machines aren’t fully ready yet. They’re often referred
    to as NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) devices, a term coined by quantum
    computing pioneer John Preskill. These machines are still considered early versions
    of the more advanced quantum computers we hope to see in the future.

    available. For comparison…
