    of Generative AI (GenAI) state-of-the-art, explaining the difference from normal
    LLM.

    are entities acting with enough understanding to perceive the environment, take
    actions autonomously to achieve specific goals, and improve by acquiring knowledge
    (like humans).

- en: In tech, an **AI Agent** is an autonomous program that performs tasks, makes
    decisions, and communicates with other entities. Usually, Agents are provided
    with a set of tools that they can decide to use while completing the task. This
    concept extends Reinforcement Learning, where an agent picks from a defined set
    of actions to maximize the reward in an interactive environment.

    not Agents.LLMs are Neural Networks that utilize [word embedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding)
    and [transformer architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(deep_learning_architecture))
