    was the EU’s research and innovation funding program from 2014–2020 with a budget
    of nearly €80 billion, funding research projects across the continent at various
    scales, covering topics from Anthropology to Particle Physics. As these grants
    usually funded international research, many of them were awarded to joint efforts
    of collaborative parties.

    data sets published about H2020 to have a brief overview on how these chunks of
    EU fundings were distributed across thousands of actors and hundreds of research
    topics. For that, I will use data shared by [CORDIS](https://cordis.europa.eu/projects).

    science or EU funding (or both).

    major trends of the data set, such as most funded topics and institutions. Then,
    I show a quick way to use Python to…
