- en: A decision tree is a non-parametric supervised learning algorithm that can be
    used for both classification and regression. It uses a tree-like structure to
    represent decisions and their potential outcomes. Decision trees are simple to
    understand and interpret and can be easily visualized. However, when a decision
    tree model becomes too complex, it does not generalize well from the training
    data and results in overfitting.

- en: Gradient boosting is an ensemble learning model in which we combine many weak
    learners to develop a strong learner. The weak learners are the individual decision
    trees, and each learner tries to focus on the mistakes of the previous ones. Gradient
    boosting is typically less prone to overfitting compared to a single deep decision
    tree.

    classification and regression problems. We will see how this model works and why
    it can result in overfitting. Next, we will introduce gradient boosting and see
    how it can improve the performance of a single decision tree. A gradient boosting
    regressor and classifier will be implemented from scratch in Python. Finally,
    the math…
