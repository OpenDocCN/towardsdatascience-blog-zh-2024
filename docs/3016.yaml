- en: For data engineers, SQL is probably the most important language. As a web developer,
    you need to know JavaScript, HTML, CSS and PHP in your sleep. For data scientists,
    on the other hand, Python and R are the preferred tools. Both languages have their
    strengths and weaknesses — and both offer powerful tools and a large community
    to analyze and visualize data.

    R and Python can be overwhelming. But if you want to move into this field in the
    long term, you will come into contact with both languages sooner or later anyway.
    Also, if you’re already at university, you probably have courses in both languages.
