- en: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a specialized kind of deep neural networks
    designed primarily for processing structured array data such as images. CNNs operate
    by recognizing patterns directly from pixel data of images, eliminating the need
    for manual feature extraction. They are particularly powerful in understanding
    the spatial hierarchy in images, utilizing learnable filters that process data
    in patches and thus preserving the spatial relationships between pixels.
