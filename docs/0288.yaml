- en: The role of statistics in Data Science is central, bridging raw data to actionable
    insights. However, not all statistical methods are created equal, especially when
    faced with the harsh realities of (messy) real-world data. This brings us to the
    purpose of robust statistics, a subfield designed to withstand the anomalies of
    data that often throw traditional statistical methods off course.

- en: While classical statistics have served us well, their susceptibility to outliers
    and extreme values can lead to misleading conclusions. Enter robust statistics,
    which aims to provide more reliable results under a wider variety of conditions.
    This approach is not about discarding outliers without consideration but about
    developing methods that are less sensitive to them.

    statistical methods that remain unaffected, or minimally affected, by small deviations
    from assumptions that traditional methods hold dear. This…
