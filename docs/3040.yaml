    transitions — both [for the TDS team](https://towardsdatascience.medium.com/community-announcement-insight-media-group-llc-acquires-towards-data-science-publication-fc1adcb3e378)
    and, in many meaningful ways, for the data science, machine learning, and AI communities
    at large. We’d like to thank all of you—readers, authors, and followers—for your
    support, and for keeping us busy and engaged with your excellent contributions
    and comments.

    beginning of the year) stopped everyone in their tracks and shaped conversations
    for months on end, this year we experienced a more cumulative and fragmented sense
    of transformation. Practitioners across industry and academia experimented with
    new tools and worked hard to find innovative ways to benefit from the rapid rise
    of LLMs; at the same time, they also had to navigate a challenging job market
    and a world where AI’s footprint inches ever closer to their own everyday workflows.

    this past year, including hundreds from first-time contributors. Our authors have
    an incredible knack for injecting their unique perspective into any topic they
    cover—from big questions and timely topics to more focused technical challenges—and
    we’re proud of every post we published in 2024.

    well with our readers, and we’re dedicating our final Variable edition to these:
    our most-read, -discussed, and -shared posts of the year. As you might expect,
    they cover *a lot* of ground, so we’ve decided to arrange them following the major
    themes we’ve detected this year: learning and building from scratch, RAG and AI
    agents, career growth, and breakthroughs and innovation.'

    realized that these powerful models aren’t all that useful out of the box. Retrieval-augmented
    generation and agentic AI rose to prominence in the past year as the two leading
    approaches that bridge the gap between the models’ potential and real-world value;
    they also ended up being our most covered technical topics in recent months.
