- en: From no-code platforms to complex coding solutions, we have numerous options
    to build an app. Creating a functional app from scratch can be very overwhelming.
    If you are an analyst and you know Python and SQL, then you are in luck. Python
    provides powerful libraries which makes it perfect for anyone who wants to create
    interactive apps quickly — without needing deep knowledge of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.

- en: '[**Streamlit**](https://docs.streamlit.io/) is one such open-source Python
    library that allows you to build custom web applications with minimal efforts.
    It takes care of the front-end components allowing you to focus purely on writing
    your Python code. With Streamlit sharing, one can also deploy their Streamlit
    apps for free easily. [**SQLite**](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html), on the other
    hand, is a lightweight, server-less database engine included with Python. It requires
    no additional setup and allows you to save your app’s data in a local file, making
    it incredibly portable and simple to use.'

    application backed by a powerful back-end database system. Follow along with me
    in this article where I explore how to create a simple expense management app
    to record personal expenses and export all the data for further analysis.
