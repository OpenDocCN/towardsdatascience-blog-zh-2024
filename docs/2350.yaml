    time-consuming, and you want to automate as much as possible to reduce manual
    work. In this article, I discuss how I have recently updated my workflow as a
    data scientist, moving away from Jupyter Notebooks and to using VS Code interactive
    windows.

    can work faster using the new workflow. You should note, however, that I think
    the benefits of the new workflow increase the more complex a project becomes.
    Many problems with Jupyter Notebooks arise when a project grows bigger, and it’s
    more difficult to have an overview of your data. Thus, I think the benefits of
    the workflow I am showcasing in this article will only increase with real-world
    projects. I will use pictures and videos throughout the article to visually showcase
    how you can work with the VS Code interactive window. My inspiration for this
    article was [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFvInA7DKuE&t=395s)
    from Dave Ebbelaar about how he stopped using Jupyter Notebook.
