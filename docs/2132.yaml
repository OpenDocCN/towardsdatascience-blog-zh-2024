    for my own data science work](/using-an-ipad-for-data-science-in-2021-d6a973dd27ab),
    so I thought I’d share a follow up given that, yes, I am still using an iPad for
    my own work here in September 2024\. I ended the 2021 post with the following

    is, can we finally use solely the iPad for data science work? The unfortunate

    there are many things I cannot do due to my reliance on command line tools, Docker
    images, and more. I’ll be interested to see if Apple is ever able to overcome
