- en: Around 10 months ago I decided that after several years of purely academic professional
    experience I want to try some freelancing/consulting. However, I found that my
    skill set was somewhat rare and weird.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the one hand, my masters degree in Big Data and Machine Learning equipped
    me with a range of very helpful tools and knowledge of industrial data processing,
    modeling and analysis. However, I was extremely far from calling myslef an expert.
    Let’s say I had the skills of a junior data sceintist.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, coming from the earth science domain, I knew how to work
    with geospatial data with a particular focus on remote sensing data (like satellite
    imagery for instance). Dumping a scenery from one of the NASA APIs, masking it,
    and performing some calculations was not a hard task for me at all. However, to
    call yourself an expert in this field you need to have a much deeper understanding
    of atmospheric optics, physics, and geoinformational systems (GIS).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So being eager to gain a taste of the world outside academia, I ended up trying
    to balance these two fields. Surprisingly, it turned out to be quite a good decision
    because this expertise is **specific** and **niche**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'There are tens of thousands of people worldwide who excel in machine learning
    developing the most crazy architectures, and others, who possess solid knowledge
    of remote sensing and satellite data processing. However, there are far fewer
    professionals who bridge these two fields. And I thought to myself: I might become
    one of them!'

- en: I strongly believe that the word **niche** is one the most important in this
    story. Firstly, I was scared of it. What if no one needs it? What if I don’t have
    projects, i.e. money? What if this expertise is too specific?

    for acquiring clients, with an impressive number of geo data science projects
    available. Recognizing the potential, I signed up, quickly filled out my profile,
    and showcased a pet project in my portfolio.'

    (ranging from **$25** to **$50** for everything). There are two significant issues
    associated with this kind of work:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, even if the task seems to be straightforward, you’ll likely spend at
    least an hour communicating with the client, collecting data, uploading results,
    and performing the analysis or modeling itself. At best, you’ll earn around **$20**
    per hour, but more often, it’s closer to **$10** or **$12**.

- en: Second, clients with low budgets tend to be the most demanding. On average,
    they introduce new requirements along the way and frequently request additional
    revisions. These clients typically prefer fixed-price projects, meaning that regardless
    of how much effort, time, or resources you invest, the budget remains the same
    — and it’s usually quite small (i.e. **RIDICULOUSLY SMALL**). That’s just how
    it is. I’d be glad to hear if you’ve had a different experience!
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, there are projects that are small by nature, for sure. I had a couple
    of experiences when I was asked to fix someone’s code, and those projects were
    very smooth and enjoyable for me (hopefully for the clients as well). For these
    minor corrections, I was compensated on an **hourly basis**, making the work just**!**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nevertheless, those first two or three projects were crucial, as my profile
    was still mostly blank. No major client would trust a profile without established
    work. The key was to consistently apply for jobs.

    from various clients.

    communication, pitching, and negotiation skills to exploring new approaches, models,
    libraries, and tools in my field.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After **five** months of being a freelancer, I managed to secure a stable workload
    of 20 to 25 hours per week, which was perfect for me at that time. In total, my
    gross income on UpWork between January and August 2024 was **$6,338,** which I
    consider to be a very good number for a person with around 0 experience.

    to return in the future!

- en: Do not call yourself just a Machine Learning Engineer, but Financial Data Scientist/Data
    Annotator/Medical Computer Vision Expert/LLM Architect, or Geo Data Scientist
    like in my case. You’ll be able to get a general data science project, but you’ll
    also a have a fixed niche.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Almost all the projects I had were in the geospatial field, but one of them
    was focused on the synthesis of the NLP datasets from scientific literature. I
    definitely had the competence to collect, structure, and describe this kind of
    data, despite officially being a *geo* person. By the way, the client gave 5/5
    stars! So the niche will not limit you, don’t worry.
  prefs: []

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sounds controversial, but please believe me. I saw hundreds of projects with
    more than 50 proposals from other freelancers. You don’t want this competition
    not because you’re not worth it, but because the client just won’t be able to
    adequately estimate the skills of all the professionals. They just want the work
    to be done.
  prefs: []

    but avoid any false expectations about you working on this contract.

    you might find that other freelancers mentioned the name of this person in their
    reviews, so please address clients by **their** **names**!

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Add an external portfolio like GitHub/personal website or any other platform
    which can become an indicator of your skills. UpWork allows you to attach up to
    3 projects from your UpWork portfolio, which often is not enough. So definitely
    share some links with the client to get familiar with other projects of yours
    more deeply. In my case, many clients referred to my blog on Medium as one of
    the key reasons to hire me. It’s a straightforward way to see my technical and
    communications skills.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, don’t center the proposal around your personality. I know you want to
    prove you’re the best for this project. But no one cares, sorry. The only thing
    the client cares about is the problem being solved. So focus on it. Show your
    care and passion to help. Treat the client like a doctor willing to heal a wound,
    not a businessman chasing another payday.

    projects on many different platforms, get the contract, and then go to UpWork
    to hire someone else for the lower price.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    other side. They are not in the context of the project at all.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    He ended up creating a group chat with me and the initial client asking me not
    to tell this person that I’m the one doing the job.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The solution is simple: check their previous projects. Normally, the agents
    have tons of reviews (not necessarily bad). But the titles of the projects are
    not connected at all. If this person is hiring people to do data analysis, satellite
    imagery processing, editing a video, solving math olympiad, and 3D design, it
    does look suspicious!'
  prefs: []

- en: '**V.** Use GPT to make your pet project shine. Anything you put in your portfolio
    on UpWork should have some story behind it. In the very beginning the only thing
    you have is a pet project or some assignment from a class. Leverage ChatGPT to
    create a compelling description of your work. Make it look like a real job with
    some impact and industry application.'
  prefs: []

    **4–5 examples of your work is enough**.
