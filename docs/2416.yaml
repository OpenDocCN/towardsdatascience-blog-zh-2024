- en: Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have captured the imagination of
    the world. With the release of [ChatGPT by OpenAI](https://chatgpt.com/), in November,
    2022, previously obscure terms like Generative AI entered the public discourse.
    In a short time LLMs found a wide [applicability in modern language processing
    tasks](https://pixelplex.io/blog/llm-applications/) and even paved the way for
    [autonomous AI agents](https://www.promptingguide.ai/research/llm-agents). Some
    call it a watershed moment in technology and make lofty comparisons with the advent
    of the internet or even the invention of the light bulb. Consequently, a vast
    majority of business leaders, software developers and entrepreneurs are in hot
    pursuit of using LLMs to their advantage.

- en: Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG, stands as a pivotal technique shaping
    the landscape of the applied generative AI. A novel concept introduced by Lewis
    et al in their seminal paper [*Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive
    NLP Tasks*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401), RAG has swiftly emerged as a cornerstone,
    enhancing reliability and trustworthiness in the outputs from Large Language Models.

    before that, let us set up the context by understanding the need for RAG and getting
    an overview of the implementation of RAG pipelines.
