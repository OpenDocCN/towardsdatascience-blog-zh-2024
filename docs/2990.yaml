    [OpenAI’s o1 model](https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242439/openai-o1-model-reasoning-strawberry-chatgpt),
    released a few months ago, was welcomed with a [mix of reactions](https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/openais-o1-is-it-a-new-reasoning-paradigm-or-just-smoke-and-mirrors-bd0d110e581d?sk=5538db01e35836ac090f6d835536b392),
    ranging from “It’s just smoke and mirrors” to “A new paradigm of AI.”

    General Intelligence” or “AI got to the level of a PhD” to radical dismissals
    of the reasoning capabilities of AI, like “Apple Calls Bullshit On The AI Revolution.”

    by fans of Elon Musk. In this piece, I examine the opposite end of the spectrum:
    people who claim AI can’t reason at all.'
