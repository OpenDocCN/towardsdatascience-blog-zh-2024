- en: Writing clean code is not just a nice thing to have. Writing clean code is required
    whenever you run production-ready code.

- en: As a data scientist, I primarily worked with Jupyter Notebooks, aiming to develop
    a model that works with the available data. In the beginning, it was all about
    showing that, in general, AI can provide a value given the data.

    And this is where the pain started.

- en: Most of the code was ugly and not readable and maintainable. As a Data Scientist,
    I honestly didn’t really care.

    than writing clean code whenever you write code that shall be reused and put into
    production.

    This book is the manifesto for writing clean code. Its principles are applicable
    to all programming languages, even if the book always relates to Java.'

- en: In this article, I highlight the most important clean code rules and want to
    adapt these principles to Python so that you can directly relate them to your
    day-to-day coding.
