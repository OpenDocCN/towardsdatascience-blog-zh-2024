- en: In recent years, the AI field has been obsessed with building larger and larger
    neural networks, believing that more complexity leads to better performance. Indeed,
    this approach has yielded incredible results, leading to breakthroughs in image
    recognition, language translation, and countless other areas.

- en: But there’s a catch. Just like a massive, overly complex machine can be costly
    to build and maintain, these enormous neural networks require significant computational
    resources and time to train. They can be slow, demanding a lot of memory and power,
    making deploying them on devices with limited resources challenging. Plus, they
    often become prone to “memorizing” the training data rather than truly understanding
    the underlying patterns, leading to poor performance on unseen data.

- en: Sparse neural networks have partly solved the problem above. Think of sparse
    NNs as a leaner version of classic NNs. They carefully remove unnecessary parts
    and connections, resulting in a more efficient and leaner model that still maintains
    its power. They can train faster, require less memory, and are often more robust…
