When you and I chat, we assume that the same words mean the same things because we have seen the same world. If we talk about chairs, we can point to a chair. The word “chair” refers to a thing in the world. But a chatbot has never seen a chair, or anything else. For a chatbot, a word cannot possibly refer to a thing in the world, since it has no access to the world. It appears to know what it is talking about because it was trained on data downloaded from the web, which were uploaded by people who know what they are talking about. A chatbot has never seen a chair, or a tree, or a cow, or felt pain, but his chats are remixes of the chats between people who have. Chatbot’s words do not refer to things directly, but indirectly, through people’s words. The next image illustrates how this works.</p><figure class="py pz qa qb qc qd pv pw paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="qe qf ed qg bh qh"><div class="pv pw qj"><img src="../Images/65e26bc5f58e9af241eedad3f2656ad1.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*nArkKxTgJZv0WmEioGrJbg.jpeg"/></div></div><figcaption class="qk ql qm pv pw qn qo bf b bg z dx">People use words to refer to the world, chatbots to extend phrases | Image created by the author</figcaption></figure><p id="2019" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nw nx fq ny b gt oq oa ob gw or od oe nk os og oh no ot oj ok ns ou om on oo fj bk">When I say “cow’’, it is because I have a cow on my mind. When a chatbot says “cow”, it is because that word is a likely completion of the preceding context. Many theories of meaning have been developed in different parts of linguistics and philosophy, often subsumed under the common name <em class="qp">semiotics</em>. While they differ in many things, they mostly stick with the picture on the left, of meaning as a relation between a signifying token, say a written or spoken word, and a signified item, an object, or a concept. While many semioticists noted that words and other fragments of language are also referred to by words and other fragments of language, the fact that the entire process of language production can be realized within a self-contained system of references, as a whirlwind of words arising from words — as <em class="qp">demonstrated</em> by chatbots — is a fundamental, unforeseen challenge.

An empiric counterexample. For all we know, Zeno did not intend to disprove his teacher’s claims and neither Parmenides nor Plato (who presented Parmenides’ philosophy in eponymous dialogue) seem to have noticed the tension between Parmenides’ denial of the possibility of movement and Zeno’s actual movement. Philosophy and the students pacing around were not viewed in the same realm. (Ironically, when the laws of motion were finally understood some 2000 years later, Parmenides’ argument, popularized in Zeno’s story about Achilles and tortoise, played an important role.)</p><p id="eb52" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nw nx fq ny b gt oq oa ob gw or od oe nk os og oh no ot oj ok ns ou om on oo fj bk">Before you dismiss concerns about words and things and Zeno and the chatbots as a philosophical conundrum of no consequence for our projects in science and engineering, note that the self-contained language models, built and trained by chatbot researchers and their companies, could just as well be built and trained by an alien spaceship parked by the Moon. They could listen in, crawl our websites, scrub the data, build neural networks, train them to speak on our favorite topics in perfect English, provide compelling explanations, illustrate them in vivid colors. Your friendly AI could be operated by product engineers in San Francisco, or in Pyongyang, or on the Moon. They don’t need to understand the chats to build the chatbots.

One of the first steps into modern science was his realization that living organisms were driven by the same physical mechanisms as the rest of nature, i.e. that they were in essence similar to the machines built at the time. One thing that he couldn’t figure out was how the human body gives rise to the human mind.

That part of the story seems well-known. When the war ended, he turned down positions at Cambridge and Princeton and accepted work at the National Physics Laboratory, hoping to build a computer and test the idea of machine intelligence. The 1947 memo contains what seems to be the first emergence of the ideas of training neural networks, and of supervised and unsupervised learning. It was so far ahead of its time that some parts seem still ahead. It was submitted to the director of the National Physics Laboratory Sir Charles G. Darwin, a grandson of Charles Darwin and a prominent eugenicist on his own account. In Sir Darwin’s opinion, Turing’s memo read like a “fanciful school-boy’s essay”. Also resenting Turing’s “smudgy’’ appearance, Sir Darwin smothered the computer project by putting it under strict administrative control. The machine intelligence memo sank into oblivion for more than 20 years. Turing devoted the final years until his death (at the age of 42, by biting into a cyanide-laced apple!) to exploring the computational aspects of life. E.g., what determines the shape of the black spots on a white cow’s hide? Life always interested him.</p><figure class="py pz qa qb qc qd pv pw paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="qe qf ed qg bh qh"><div class="pv pw qx"><img src="../Images/df26c10f60d0f9844d42f0060d83cfa3.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*IvnZY5yntQb8RDh79Be9Pw.jpeg"/></div></div><figcaption class="qk ql qm pv pw qn qo bf b bg z dx">11-year-old Alan Turing, drawn by his mother at a hockey match | Courtesy of Sherborne School</figcaption></figure><p id="4a70" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nw nx fq ny b gt oq oa ob gw or od oe nk os og oh no ot oj ok ns ou om on oo fj bk">2 years after Turing’s death (9 years after the <em class="qp">Intelligent Machinery</em> memo), Turing’s <em class="qp">machine intelligence</em> got renamed to <em class="qp">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</em> at the legendary Dartmouth workshop.</p><p id="2288" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nw nx fq ny b gt oq oa ob gw or od oe nk os og oh no ot oj ok ns ou om on oo fj bk">The history of artificial intelligence is mostly a history of efforts towards <strong class="ny ga"><em class="qp">intelligent design</em></strong><em class="qp"> of intelligence</em>.

The main published account of his thoughts on the topic appeared in the journal <em class="qp">“Mind”</em>. The paper opens with the question: “Can machines think?”. What we now call the <em class="qp">Turing Test</em> is offered as a means for deciding the answer. The idea is that a machine that can maintain a conversation and remain indistinguishable from a thinking human being must be recognized as a thinking machine. At this time of confusion around chatbots, the closing paragraph of the <em class="qp">“Mind”</em> paper seems particularly interesting:</p><blockquote class="qy qz ra"><p id="2e21" class="nw nx qp ny b gt oq oa ob gw or od oe nk os og oh no ot oj ok ns ou om on oo fj bk">An important feature of a learning machine is that its teacher will often be very largely ignorant of quite what is going on inside, although he may still be able to some extent to predict his pupil’s behavior. […] This is in clear contrast with a normal procedure when using a machine to do computations: one’s object is then to have a clear mental picture of the state of the machine at each moment in the computation. This object can only be achieved with a struggle. The view that `the machine can only do what we know how to order it to do’, appears strange in the face of this fact. Intelligent behaviour presumably consists in a departure from the completely disciplined behaviour.</p></blockquote><p id="97f8" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nw nx fq ny b gt oq oa ob gw or od oe nk os og oh no ot oj ok ns ou om on oo fj bk">Designers and builders of chatbots and language engines published many accounts of their systems’ methods and architectures but seem as stumped as everyone by their behaviors.

Neither the nodes nor the network can reliably tell them apart. “I think, therefore I exist” may be stated as a hallucination. But this extended mind solves problems that no participant node could solve alone, by methods that are not available to any of them, and by nonlocal methods. Its functioning engenders nonlocal forms of awareness and attention. Language engines (they call themselves AIs) are built as a convenience for human customers, and their machine intelligence is meant to be a convenient extension of human intelligence. But the universality of the underlying computation means that the machine intelligence subsumes the human thinking, and vice versa.
