    and I think it brought (or hopefully will bring) value. But it came at an [expense](https://github.com/chrislydick/sps-budget-analysis/blob/main/elementary_school_data_extract.ipynb)
    which I’ve become all too familiar with in my industry. It shouldn’t be (and doesn’t
    have to be) the norm that data is difficult to access. *I refer to this as* ***Data
    Jail****.* It’s easy to get data in, hard to get it back out. And many cases,
    the proverbial bars of the data jail are transparent. You don’t know it’s hard
    to get to until you need to.

    Essentially, **Data Jail** describes a scenario where data, despite being technically
    available, is confined within formats that hinder easy access, analysis, and effective
    usage. Common culprits include PDFs and other document formats that are not designed
    for seamless data extraction and manipulation.

    school year that they were unable to overcome a budget shortfall in excess of
    $100M/year and growing through time. Soon after, [a program](https://www.seattleschools.org/resources/well-resourced-schools/)
    and analysis were initiated which aimed to identify and close up to 20 of the
    nearly 70 elementary schools in Seattle.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’m a parent of one of the kids in one of these elementary schools. And like
    many of the other parents who were thrust upon this program without much warning,
    I felt frustrated at the lack of open & readily available data, even though the
    district pointed towards [numerous](https://www.seattleschools.org/departments/finance/budget/current-budget/)
    PDFs available through their webpage.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    going to take a tremendous amount of time.

    by 2 part-time individuals](https://www.seattleschools.org/departments/legal-department/public-records-requests/),
    and the lead time for getting the data is measured in months, not days.
  prefs: []

    need to come to a reasonable conclusion on which schools (if any) to close. Obvious
    information like Budget, Enrollment and Facilities data — for the past 3 years
    by school.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Thankfully I did not have to copy & paste the data manually. Instead, I used
    [Python](https://github.com/chrislydick/sps-budget-analysis/blob/main/elementary_school_data_extract.ipynb)
    to scrape the PDFs in order to get a dataset which anyone could use to perform
    a robust analysis. It still took forever.

    is hosted on [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io), which is a super-slick platform
    that provides all of the scaffolding and support to quickly enable exploration
    of your data, or provide a UI on top of your code. You get to spend time on solving
    the problem instead of having to fiddle with buttons, HTML and the like.

    can then select schools to see the before/after from a metrics and a map perspective
    to see how students are re-distributed to other schools upon closing any number
    of schools. Image by author.

- en: My exploration began as an examination of the budgets and enrollment themselves,
    but then quickly morphed into a way to understand one of many impacts from closing
    schools — specifically, how do the students become redistributed based on existing
    relationships between enrollment boundaries and number of students who attend
    within or outside of them.

    3400+ students to be redistributed to other schools, and most schools seeing substantial
    increases in their % of capacity. This scenario caused an additional 24 schools
    to exceed 100% capacity. Image by author.

- en: I did make an interesting observation while analyzing this data. This observation
    was done just after completing a fairly simple linear regression. **The y-intercept
    for the regression was around $760k**, which represented an estimated baseline
    cost for having a school open. In simpler terms, by closing a school, and redistributing
    staff and budget dollars, the district will probably see on average $760k in cost
    savings per school. Therefore closing up to 20 schools, maintaining staffing levels,
    and redistributing students, would save a little over $15M. There’s a big gap
    between that and the $100M deficit that the closures intend to address. This probably
    warrants some additional analysis — if only I had access to better (or even more)
    data…

    approvals, and been provided that data. And even though that data shared with
    the requestor is considered public, it’s not made accessible to anyone else in
    an easy way. Herein lies the problem. *Why can’t I just look at and use the data

    data from PDFs [using a thing](https://github.com/chrislydick/sps-budget-analysis/blob/main/elementary_school_data_extract.ipynb).
    But, I also have a request in the queue with Seattle Public Schools and Seattle.gov
    to get access to any information provided via public requests and FOIAs for public
    school data over the last 2 years. Those responses and the requests are also themselves
    public records.

    this data remains just beyond arm’s length, locked behind the bars of PDFs, webpages,
    & images. It doesn’t have to be that way. And, it shouldn’t be that way.

    for data in the first place. Things like standard table formats such as [Delta
    Lake](https://delta.io/) seem like a very scalable and reasonable solution across
    the board (Thank you [Robert Dale Thompson](https://medium.com/u/55be6f6be025?source=post_page---user_mention--9051c78e29f3--------------------------------)),
    but even making the data from past FOIAs and public records requests accessible
    on existing sites such as [data.seattle.gov](https://data.seattle.gov/) seem like
    table stakes.
