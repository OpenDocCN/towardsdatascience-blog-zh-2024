- en: When you are learning a technical subject that has numerous equations and relationships,
    such as petrophysics, it can sometimes be difficult to understand how all of the
    parameters tie together.

- en: Back when I started out in petrophysics many years ago, I used Excel to explore
    some common equations, such as the Archie Water Saturation equation. It was a
    great way to understand the impact of each of the parameters on the calculated
    result.

- en: Within this article we will explore, with Python, three different ways that
    we can learn and understand the impacts of different parameters on an equation.
    The example equation used is the Archie Water Saturation (Sw) equation, which
    is used to calculate the amount of pore volume within a rock that is filled with
    water. This can then be used to infer how much hydrocarbon is present in the rock.

    can be applied to any equation of your choice. You may need to adjust the final
    example to show the data you want to see.
