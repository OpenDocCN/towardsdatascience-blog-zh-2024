- en: In this article we’ll discuss “LLM routing”, an advanced inferencing technique
    which can automatically choose the right language model, out of a selection of
    language models, for a given prompt; improving the performance, speed, and cost
    in LLM-powered systems.

- en: 'We’ll explore four approaches to LLM routing: three from academia and one from
    industry, in order to form a thorough understanding of the concept and technology.
    In doing so we’ll explore a variety of modeling strategies which are useful in
    important AI use cases, like self-evaluation, autonomous systems, and decision
    making in the face of uncertainty.'
