    is a computer, as it processes data much faster than we can. Imagine trying to
    do any task involving data without one, with— *gasp* *—* pencil and paper at your
    side, hand drawing an exhausting number of tables, graphs, and calculations for
    what you know would take seconds on a computer. It is pretty safe to say that
    data science wouldn’t exist today without computers.

    you would expect that the job would require an understanding of how computers
    work. After all, it’s hard to do a job right when you don’t understand your tools.
    However, for the aspiring data scientist, it is all too easy to neglect to take
    the time to build the foundational knowledge surrounding the field.

- en: And, that’s understandable. Theoretical topics in mathematics, computer science,
    and engineering are often relegated to the role of secondary learning objectives
    because they are not as immediately rewarding (or immediately employable, honestly)
    as are more application-focused learning objectives like Python, Tensorflow, or
    Amazon Web Services. Why wouldn’t a…
