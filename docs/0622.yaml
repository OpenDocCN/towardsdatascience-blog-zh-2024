- en: I was back in the job search market in August 2023\. Despite the challenging
    status quo and massive layoffs from big tech companies, I took a leap of faith
    and left my company to dedicate full-time to finding my next role in the Machine
    Learning/Data Science area.

    reality turned out to be longer than this. So, this process has been a marathon
    rather than a sprint for me. Luckily, I finished the marathon this month üéâ

    diagram that went viral on LinkedIn is proof of this statement. It shows the application
    statistics of a job seeker in marketing tech. From my experience, I can tell it
    is a valid statistic for the data science/machine learning domain.

- en: I got 23 successful responses and 5 offers out of 100 applications. The rest
    was either ghosting or rejections. At first, I was demotivated and felt down with
    every rejection I received. I even cried after some rejections where I felt a
    high culture fit with the company and a strong match with my skills ü•≤. After several
    downs, I learned to go through the disappointment of the rejection and not to
    couple it with my self-worth.

    open again in the future and requirements might change. You likely improved yourself
    in the meantime.

    MLOps Engineer and Data Scientist roles. I was eliminated from the process after
    the first interview. Fast forward to February 2024, I got offers from both companies
    for a Machine Learning Engineer role. So never give up and keep trying ‚úåüèº

    This is an example of [the spray-and-pray approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iheR2yPLZHQ).
    It is the traditional way of submitting a generic r√©sum√© for every job posting
    through the company‚Äôs careers page.

    appears first, mention your qualities that the job description lists, and make
    sure you use [active verbs](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/active-verbs#:~:text=Active%20verbs%2C%20also%20called%20%22action,the%20action%20in%20the%20sentence.).

    process. Most companies document their recruitment process, values, and qualities
    they look for in candidates. Also, learn about the products & problems they are
    working on before crafting your cover letter. Then embed those learnings and values
    in your cover letter and ensure to highlight the technical skills listed in the
    role requirements.

    hesitate to reach out to your network (ex-colleagues, college friends, etc.).
    Ask if they want to be a reference for you. You will be surprised to see that
    people are there to support you. I believe this support is coming from an empathy
    space where every one of us has been a job seeker in life once üòå

    and my CV. It calculates a percentage based on the keywords in your CV and job
    posting. While tailoring your CV, you can aim for a good match score to help you
    pass the initial screening. Moreover, Teal suggests improvements for your CV in
    terms of wording and framing your achievements.

    humans in creative writing. I see cover letters and CVs as a form of creative
    writing in a professional manner. So don‚Äôt solely rely on a cover letter or CV
    prepared by an AI-based tool. Always evaluate their output, and use their suggestions
    as feedback.
