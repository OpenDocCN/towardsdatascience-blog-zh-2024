    The first and maybe the most important part of this task is to collect, scrape,
    and clean textual data to feed the LLM. I noticed that my code was becoming messy
    with many repetitions, because for every identified source I was writing a script
    from scratch which had a lot of things in common with other scripts in my codebase.
    I was not following the “***Don’t repeat yourself***” (DRY) principle at all.
    This is why I decided to implement the Template Design Pattern and make my code
    base more elegant and efficient.

- en: I won’t repeat here what a design pattern is and how we classify design patterns
    based on their functionalities, since I’ve written many articles on the subject.
    If you are interested in reading my previous articles on this topic I will leave
    some references at the end.

    Let’s say that in our project we have to deal with different kinds of data that
    we want to analyze. Some of these data are…
