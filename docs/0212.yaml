- en: Transformers have been widely applied to Natural Language Processing use cases
    but they can also be applied to several other domains of Artificial Intelligence
    such as time series forecasting or computer vision.

- en: Great examples of Transformers models applied to computer vision are Stable
    Diffusion for image generation, Detection Transformer for object detection or,
    more recently, SAM for image segmentation. The great benefit that these models
    bring is that we can use text prompts to manipulate images without much effort,
    all it takes is a good prompt.

- en: The use cases for this type of models are endless, specially if you work at
    an e-commerce company. A simple, time consuming and expensive use case is the
    process from photographing an item to posting it on the website for sale. Companies
    need to photograph the items, remove the props used and, finally, in-paint the
    hole left by the prop before posting the item in the website. What if this entire
    process could be automated by AI and our human resources would just handle the
    complex use cases and review what was done by AI?

- en: In this article, I provide a detailed explanation of SAM, an image segmentation
    model, and its implementation on a hypothetical use case where we want to perform
    an A/B test to understand which type of background would increase conversion rate.
