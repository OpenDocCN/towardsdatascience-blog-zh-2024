    truthfully, a really significant portion of time was just dedicated to improving
    prompts to get my desired output from the LLM.

- en: There have been many moments where I run into a sort of existential void, asking
    myself if I might just be a glorified prompt engineer. Given the current state
    of interacting with LLMs, I’m still inclined to conclude with ‘Not Yet’, and on
    most nights, I overcome my imposter syndrome. Won’t get into that today.

    mostly automated away. And I think the answer to this futuristic scenario hinges
    on uncovering the nature of prompt engineering.

    vast internet, I still cannot decide if prompt engineering is an **art or a science**.

- en: On one hand, it feels like an art when I have to iteratively learn and edit
    my prompts based on what I’m observing in the outputs. Over time, you learn that
    some of the tiny details matter — using ‘must’ instead of ‘should’…
