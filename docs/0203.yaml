    (PSO), as well as [Artificial Bee Colony](/artificial-bee-colony-how-it-differs-from-pso-9c6831bfb552)
    (ABC). Nature is everywhere, and there’s certainly more areas where humans can
    benefit by learning from nature.

    hadn’t taught us was that ants collectively form a highly sophisticated swarm
    that communicates with one another effectively.

    here at all. These are just names used for the purpose of packaging. I’ve shown
    previously that you do not need the slightest knowledge of a bee’s waggle dance
    in order to appreciate or utilize ABC, nor do you need to learn about genes or
    mutations or reproduction to apply EA.

    very basic math and python programming skills. While I will be showing some mathematics
    for completeness, which includes Greek symbols, it is really just for the purpose
    of completeness. It…
