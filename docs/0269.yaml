    allow and encourage the exploration of the world while at the same time making
    sure the players finish the main quests and follow a certain set of rules?
  prefs: []

- en: Analytics managers who are trying to enable their less savvy colleagues with
    dashboards know this exact same problem. They constantly face this tension between
    “exploration” and “exploitation”. On one hand, they need to build a system that
    is comprehensive enough to allow for the exploration of edge cases. On the other
    hand, they must not “drown” their users with too much information. Finding the
    right balance is often pretty complicated.

    the customer you’re meeting with in a few minutes has been spending with your

    filters to use — your customer has multiple business locations so you need to
    filter by them all. Then the dashboard takes 2 minutes to load the last 6 months,
    but you actually needed the last 2 years and you forgot to update the filter for

    the line (from maintenance to conflicting data). It is important to always keep
    track of which dashboard is solving which use cases — and make sure what can be
    consolidated is consolidated. Your “dashboard ecosystem” (i.e. your suite of dashboards)
    will thrive only if you have a holistic approach and you make sure that each of
    your tools are differentiated and don’t overlap.

    “HOW”. You can build the best tools in the world, but if your users don’t know
    about them, or if they don’t know how to use them — then they will never generate
    any value.
