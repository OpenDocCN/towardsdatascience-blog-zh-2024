    program, which brings together people working in machine learning to discuss the
    latest advancements in AI. During the event, I listened to an inspiring talk by
    [**Reza Khorshidi**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rezakhorshidi/), a machine learning
    researcher at Oxford and the **Chief Product & AI Officer at ELANDI**. He spoke
    about a new concept called “Generation 1st products” in AI, which made me think
    about how AI is changing the way we work.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As AI continues to evolve, it is clear that traditional approaches, such as
    **Proof of Concept (PoC)**, are giving way to more meaningful frameworks like
    **Proof of Value (PoV)**, as companies seek not just technical feasibility but
    measurable business impact in this rapidly changing landscape.

    extraction, chatbots, or text summarisation, which once took R&D teams months
    to solve, can now be quickly addressed using Foundation Models. This represents
    a major shift in the **Generation 1st world**, where we can now assume that the
    technological aspect of these problems is already solved.

    world of AI and why organisations should transition to PoV.

- en: What is a PoC?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A **Proof of Concept (PoC)** traditionally assesses whether a solution is feasible
    before full-scale implementation. It’s designed to show that an idea can be implemented
    effectively and meets the necessary technical requirements. However, as AI solutions
    grow in complexity — incorporating machine learning, predictive analytics, and
    natural language processing — PoCs are increasingly seen as insufficient. Companies
    are now moving toward **Proof of Value (PoV)**, which not only demonstrates technical
    feasibility but also evaluates the potential business value and impact of AI systems.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**PoCs primarily address technical feasibility**, focusing on whether a technology
    or solution can be implemented. However, they often overlook broader AI challenges,
    such as **scalability, long-term value, and real-world impact**. While AI models
    can produce promising results in controlled settings, these outcomes don’t always
    translate into real business value when scaled.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: PoCs are usually **time-bound and narrow in scope**, aiming for short-term results.
    However, AI requires continuous learning and adaptation, as many machine learning
    models improve over time. Their full benefits are realised only after ongoing
    use and iteration.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Today’s decision-makers are increasingly interested in measurable business value
    — such as cost savings, revenue growth, or efficiency improvements — beyond just
    technical feasibility. In many cases, **PoCs end before a real return on investment
    (ROI) can be assessed**.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The **shift from PoC to PoV is essential** as organisations seek clear evidence
    that their AI investments will drive meaningful results. Take document intelligence
    solutions, for example. A PoV can measure time savings in document processing,
    and the operational cost reductions these improvements create — metrics that directly
    impact a company’s bottom line.

    while 50% of enterprises claim to have “integrated some form of AI,” only 21%
    have successfully embedded AI across multiple business units. Many of these projects
    fail because the AI solution falls short of business expectations.

    and defining use cases. There must be a shift in mindset and a focus on identifying
    what success looks like — whether that’s faster document processing, better fraud
    detection, or more accurate predictions.

    on **pain points like manual document review and error-prone data entry**. They

    are the specific, measurable, and achievable outcomes that a company wants to
    achieve with AI solutions.** They can be related to revenue, cost, quality, customer
    satisfaction, or any other relevant metric. The value criteria should align with
    the business goals and strategy, and prioritise them according to their importance
    and feasibility.

    progress and impact of an AI project.** They can be quantitative, such as accuracy,

    how AI projects are delivering meaningful value to stakeholders, customers, and
    users. **Value delivery involves clearly, concisely, and compellingly showcasing
    the results and benefits of an AI project.** This can be achieved through various
    methods, such as reports, dashboards, demos, or case studies.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Value alignment ensures that an AI project is consistent with the business environment
    and objectives, aligning with the expectations of stakeholders, customers, and
    users. AI projects do not operate in isolation; they are part of a broader business
    context and both influence and are influenced by factors like market trends, customer
    behaviour, and competitor actions.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Example*: A retail company implements an AI-driven demand forecasting tool
    but aligns the project goals with the company’s seasonal marketing strategies
    and customer buying trends. Regular updates with stakeholders ensure that the
    project remains aligned with both market demands and customer expectations.'

    optimisation, which may include boosting performance, reliability, usability,
    and accessibility, or reducing costs, risks, and limitations.'
