    and suddenly three arrive together. (It is supposed to be a joke but it''s also
    [true](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_bunching)).'

    we have solutions from the usual suspects, like LangChain and LlamaIndex, but
    new products are coming on the market with alarming frequency: CrewAI, MotleyCrew,
    and Autogen are some that I''ve encountered recently, but there are more frameworks
    for which I haven''t even found time to look at the README on GitHub.'

- en: Now, from one of the biggest players, OpenAI, comes **Swarm**. And because it's
    from OpenAI, I thought I should take a closer look at it. Swarm takes a step back
    from the sophistication of other products. Rather than present itself as an all-singing,
    all-dancing solution, it is an experimental, educational framework developed by
    OpenAI for exploring lightweight multi-agent orchestration. The aim, it seems,
    is for you to learn how tool-using multi-agent systems work rather than provide
    a production-ready solution like the products mentioned above.
