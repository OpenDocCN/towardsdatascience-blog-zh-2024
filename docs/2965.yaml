- en: The rules are simple. The players get six chances to guess a five-letter word.
    Wordle gives you feedback on each guess you make by highlighting the letters in
    your guessed word with green, gray, and yellow colors.

- en: The green color denotes that you made the right guess for the given letter and
    position. The yellow color indicates that the letter is present in the word but
    is misplaced. The gray color means the letter is absent in the word.

- en: A perfect guess will result in all five letters turning green. An awful guess
    could result in all gray letters. If a guess is partly correct, you may see a
    mix of yellow and gray letters, suggesting some letters are present but misplaced.

- en: Due to its interesting feedback loop that helps narrow down the list of possible
    words, Wordle is a perfect example of how concepts from Information Theory can
    enhance decision-making. I play the game for fun, but the nerd guy inside me wants
    to dive deeper into the “why” behind my guesses. What makes some guesses…
