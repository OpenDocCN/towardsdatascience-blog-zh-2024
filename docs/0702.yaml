    series. During this time, I celebrated Chinese New Year with my parents in China
    and had a mid-year performance review with my manager. While I [vlogged my experience
    in China with a video](https://youtu.be/meKtk_VOgXM?si=DTMgqOqIixKfLUAa), I haven't
    yet compiled the feedback I received from my performance review, which would be
    a great opportunity to share in this article. After all, with a few weeks passing
    my third-year working anniversary, I have reached a good point to reflect on what
    I have picked up along the way. Although the title may seem like clickbait, it
    is a summary of learnings based on my journey so far.

    during early career stages — we often doubt whether we are qualified to be offered
    this job. It is particularly ubiquitous in the tech industry because it is a fast-growing
    field. Some algorithms that were used last year might already be outdated. Everyone
    chases the latest buzzwords, which can create a lot of stress for people looking
    for a job and those on the job.
