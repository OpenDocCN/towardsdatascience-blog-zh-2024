    of my job in the VC fund was to discuss with entrepreneurs the **indicators of
    Product-Market Fit** in their business. I used to apply the [Quantitative Approach
    to Product Market Fit](https://tribecap.co/a-quantitative-approach-to-product-market-fit/)
    by Andrew Chen. We first discussed the indicators of product market fit with the
    entrepreneurs and then asked them for raw data of their users. I then played with
    the data to find the evolution of different users and their behavior in time.

    *Accounting for Growth* and *Cohorts Analysis.* In a startup, raw data is usually
    messy so I needed to code everything again and again to be able to fit the data.
    However, some weeks ago I dusted off my old notebook. With time and perspective,
    I decided to **generalize the framework** and create Python objects that are easier
    to use. In that way, you will only need to clean and prepare the datasets. The
    visualizations are done!'

    They are built in a *machine learning style*, so you can set the parameters, fit
    the object with your data, and then ask for results and visualizations. *Distribution
    of*…'
