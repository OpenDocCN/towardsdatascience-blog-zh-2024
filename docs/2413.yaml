- en: The elasticity of prices is the bread and butter of econometrics. You normally
    hear it as “[elasticity of demand](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=elasticity+of+demand&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8),”
    where you are trying to understand how much more demand there will be if we increase
    the price by a certain amount. Now in bidding ecosystems, marketeers try to understand
    how many “clicks” we will get if we increase our bids by X%. In this post, I will
    show you a way to calculate the elasticity of bids in PPC marketing.

    101 and understand what is elasticity of supply. Taken directly from [this article](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040615/how-does-price-elasticity-affect-supply.asp):
