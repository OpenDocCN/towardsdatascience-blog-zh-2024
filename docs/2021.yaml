- en: We have entered an era where large foundation models are now common. Foundation
    models have revolutionized many fields, like computer vision and natural language
    processing, with models and applications that can generate text, images and videos.

- en: The field of time series forecasting has not been impervious to this movement,
    with many foundation models appearing for forecasting. This marks an important
    paradigm shift, as we can now generate zero-shot predictions of time series data
    and avoid the costs and development time of training data-specific models.

    was published, marking the appearance of one of the first foundation forecasting
    models. Then, in February 2024, [Lag-Llama](/lag-llama-open-source-foundation-model-for-time-series-forecasting-9afdfaf2bd7c)
    was released, which was quickly followed by [Chronos](/chronos-the-latest-time-series-forecasting-foundation-model-by-amazon-2687d641705a)
    in March 2024.

    In the paper [Unified Training of Universal Time Series Forecasting Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02592),
    researchers from Salesforce propose a foundation model capable of probabilistic
    zero-shot forecasting, while also supporting exogenous features.'
