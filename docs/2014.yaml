    solution to the challenges posed by automation. At its core, UBI is a government
    provision of set amount of income for every individual, regardless of their background,
    employment status, or financial situation. This unconditional income would provide
    a financial foundation for everyone, untethered from any job or employer. It would
    not be contingent on employment, savings, or income levels. It would be universal,

    the wealthiest, would receive the same amount money.

    it. In the United States, individual income taxes are the primary source of government
    revenue. However, this situation would create a circular problem where taxes come

    to cover UBI for both workers and non-workers would put an unsustainable burden
    on those still employed, who may feel understandably resentful. Moreover, as AI
    systems increasingly replace human jobs, the shrinking workforce would struggle
    to bear the growing weight of funding the entire system.

    address the shrinking income tax base. While sales taxes can be regressive, meaning

    exemptions for essential items like groceries, medical expenses, and housing could
    ensure that a sales tax is more progressive. Ideally, profitable corporations
    would bear the brunt of the tax, as they would be the direct beneficiaries of
    AI-driven efficiency. Some might expect that corporations would simply pass the

  zh: 一些人已经提出了国家销售税作为解决收入税基缩小的可能方案。虽然销售税可能具有累退性，意味着收入较少的人往往支付相对较高比例的收入，相对于收入较多的人，但设计良好的税制可以减轻这一影响。例如，针对生活必需品如食品、医疗费用和住房的免税政策，可以确保销售税更具进步性。理想情况下，盈利企业应承担税负的主要部分，因为它们将是人工智能驱动的效率的直接受益者。有些人可能会预期企业会将成本转嫁给消费者，但人工智能驱动的生产力的收益应该能够抵消这些成本。

- en: This core concept of requiring that the benefits of AI be shared with society
    is a fundamental goal. Under the current system, people work to produce value,

    The employer also takes a slice as does the government. This leads to a zero-sum
    game where there is a limit to the total value created by a pool workers and trying

    the total amount of work done by AI is likely to be much greater than the number
    of human jobs displaced. One reason for this difference is that AI is capable
    of doing things that would be too difficult or dangerous, or conversely too trivial
    or boring for people to do. Another reason is that AI systems can be scaled up

    could be much smaller than what they would otherwise pay in payroll and payroll
    taxes. For example, instead of paying an employee $50K, plus $10K in payroll taxes
    (and hopefully some amount for benefits) to get one human unit of work done, a
    company might instead deploy ten human-equivalent AI systems, paying $1K in taxes

    human productivity do not apply to AI systems. This bounty of savings is what
    will make something like UBI possible, but only if we find a way to share that
    bounty beyond the specific owners of the AI systems.

  zh: 工作的未来将显然是由人工智能系统进行大规模自动化，并且这些人工智能系统将非常高效。人工智能系统不会请病假。由人工智能运行的工厂不需要为人类站立提供安全的空间，而且它可以24小时不间断运行。人工智能会计服务不需要花费资金在办公室空间、人员管理或培训上。如果你拥有一个由人工智能工作人员构成的企业并且想要扩展，你只需要再购买一些计算机，或许是更多的机器人。限制人类生产力的大多数因素对人工智能系统并不适用。这种节省下来的财富将使像UBI（基本收入）这样的制度成为可能，但前提是我们找到一种方法将这些财富分享给除人工智能系统拥有者之外的其他人。

    with unemployment being linked to a higher risk of depression and anxiety. Moreover,
    the financial and societal pressure to find a job can be overwhelming and debilitating.
    However, people without jobs who are financially secure often find that they’re
    able to pursue their passions without the stress of needing to earn a living.
    For instance, a well-planned and well-funded retirement provides the financial
    freedom to devote oneself to rewarding activities that bring joy and fulfillment,
    without the limitation of needing to support oneself financially.

  zh: 今天，找不到工作会带来巨大的压力和不安全感，失业与抑郁症和焦虑症的风险增加相关。此外，找工作所面临的财务和社会压力可能让人感到不堪重负，甚至令人虚弱。然而，那些没有工作但经济上比较稳定的人常常会发现，他们能够在没有生计压力的情况下去追求自己的热情。例如，一个精心规划并资金充足的退休生活可以提供财务自由，使人们能够将精力投入到带来快乐和成就感的有意义活动中，而不再受到经济压力的限制。
- en: If we find a way to share the bounty produced by AI, we could create a world
    where no one needs to struggle with poverty or homelessness. People would have
    the freedom to pursue their passions and interests, and spend their days doing
    what brings them joy. They might devote themselves to creative pursuits, adventures,
    or community service, and have the time and resources to nurture meaningful relationships.
    In this world, work would be a choice, not a necessity, and people would not spend
    most of their waking hours working for someone else.

  zh: 如果我们找到一种方法来分享由人工智能创造的财富，我们就可以创造一个没有人需要为贫困或无家可归而挣扎的世界。人们将拥有追求自己热情和兴趣的自由，可以把每天的时间花在带来快乐的事情上。他们可能会投身于创造性事业、冒险或社区服务，并且有足够的时间和资源去培养有意义的人际关系。在这个世界里，工作将成为一种选择，而不是一种必需，人们也不会把大部分清醒的时间都花在为别人工作上。
- en: This isn’t the first time someone has predicted “the end of work,” but this
    time is fundamentally different. In the past, technological advances made human
    work more efficient. Instead of spending hundreds of person hours to dig a hole,
    one person with a steam-shovel could dig it in a couple hours. Rather than painstakingly
    building something one at a time by hand, the same number of workers in a factory
    could churn out hundreds every hour. However, you still needed people. Now consider
    a factory with no people, or construction equipment that drives and operates itself.
    Production with zero people is only possible because AI systems can make operational
    decisions and handle exceptions on their own.

  zh: 这并不是第一次有人预测“工作的终结”，但这一次有着根本性的不同。过去，技术进步使得人类的工作变得更加高效。过去，挖一个坑可能需要数百小时的人工劳动，而现在一个人用蒸汽铲就能在几个小时内完成。与其手工一件件艰苦地生产，不如在工厂里同样数量的工人每小时就能生产出数百件。然而，仍然需要人类的存在。现在，试想一下没有人的工厂，或者自动驾驶和操作的建筑设备。零人生产之所以可能，正是因为AI系统能够自主做出操作决策，并处理异常情况。

  zh: 最后思考
- en: My suggestion of taxing the work done by AI system is admittedly somewhat inchoate
    and vague. It probably has a hundred problems that would need answers and thousands
    of details that need figuring out. Also, there may be much better ideas that I’ve
    overlooked, both for funding and for distributing support. A national sales tax
    or a tax on HEET are just two possibilities. Maybe something as simple as taxing
    power spent on computing would suffice, or maybe we will need complex new mathematical
    theories relating to the value of a computation.

  zh: 我建议对AI系统所做的工作征税，确实是有些初步且模糊的。它可能存在上百个需要回答的问题，以及成千上万的细节需要理清。而且，也可能存在我忽略的更好的想法，无论是在资金筹集还是分配支持方面。国家销售税或对HEET的税收只是两种可能性。也许，像对计算消耗的电力征税这么简单的做法就足够了，或者我们也许需要一些复杂的新数学理论来衡量计算的价值。
- en: I also suggested some exceptions and thresholds that would be intended to keep
    the tax burden on the corporations that can afford it and that are benefitting
    from replacing human employees with AI systems. Determining what those exceptions
    and thresholds should be will require careful thought and analysis to make the
    numbers work. A badly designed system could be worse than doing nothing. This
    problem is a place for math and economics, not political squabbling and catering
    to special interests.

  zh: 我还提出了一些例外情况和门槛，旨在确保税负落在那些能够承受且从用AI系统替代人类员工中受益的公司身上。确定这些例外和门槛的具体内容需要经过仔细的思考和分析，以确保数字能合理运作。一个设计不良的系统可能比什么都不做还要糟糕。这个问题是数学和经济学的领域，而不是政治斗争和迎合特殊利益的场所。
- en: In conclusion, my proposal for taxing AI work is just one possible solution
    for sharing the fruits of AI automation. While still in its early stages, I believe
    this is an important conversation to have. As we move forward, it’s crucial that
    we prioritize careful consideration and analysis to ensure that any solution we
    choose is fair, effective, and sustainable. Rather than getting bogged down in
    partisan politics, let’s focus on finding a solution that benefits all people,
    not just a select few.

  zh: 总之，我对AI工作的税收提案只是分享AI自动化成果的一种可能解决方案。虽然仍处于初步阶段，但我相信这是一个值得进行的重要对话。在前进的过程中，我们必须优先考虑谨慎的思考和分析，以确保我们选择的任何解决方案都公平、有效且可持续。与其陷入党派政治，不如专注于找到一个能够造福所有人的解决方案，而不仅仅是少数人。
- en: 'Regardless of what the actual solution ends up being, if we don’t find a way
    to share the bounty produces by AI systems, then I fear that most people in the
    world are going to be left behind and suffer greatly. We have a choice in front
    of us: dystopian inequity or a bright world with ample resources for all. Unfortunately,
    the default if we do nothing is the dystopian one. I very much hope that we can
    put aside our differences and fears, and focus on realizing the brighter possibility.'

  zh: 无论实际解决方案最终是什么，如果我们不找到一种方式来分享AI系统所创造的财富，那么我担心世界上大多数人将被抛在后面，并遭受极大的痛苦。我们面前有一个选择：反乌托邦的不平等，还是一个资源充足、人人共享的美好世界。不幸的是，如果我们什么都不做，默认的将是反乌托邦的情形。我非常希望我们能够放下分歧和恐惧，专注于实现那个更光明的可能性。
