    that [machines will *eventually* take over most work](https://medium.com/@objf/artificial-intelligence-and-the-future-of-work-and-living-89f8fdd7717a).
    Rather than getting bogged down in a debate about exactly when this will happen,
    in two years or in twenty, it’s more productive to ask what we can do to adapt
    and thrive in a world where work by artificial intelligence (AI) systems is growing
    increasingly prevalent, often at the cost of human jobs.

    enjoy leisure time and be empowered to live life on their own terms. The latter
    scenario isn’t just about not working. It’s about having the freedom to pursue
    what brings us joy, without the burden of financial stress. It’s about having
    the time and resources to explore our passions, travel, learn, and grow, without
    the constant pressure of making ends meet. In this scenario, people would still
    be free to work, but only because they want to, not because they have to. They

    a full-fledged startup, without the constraint of needing to fully support themselves.'

    be produced by automated AI systems and share it in a reasonable way. In the US
    our current tax structure is based primarily on taxing the work of individuals
    through income tax, but as more people inevitably lose work that source of revenue
    is going to shrink while at the same time the need for support will grow. *Instead
    of taxing a shrinking pool of human work, perhaps we should tax the growing work
    of AI systems instead.*

- en: Universal Basic Income (UBI) has gained attention in recent years as a potential
    solution to the challenges posed by automation. At its core, UBI is a government
    provision of set amount of income for every individual, regardless of their background,
    employment status, or financial situation. This unconditional income would provide
    a financial foundation for everyone, untethered from any job or employer. It would
    not be contingent on employment, savings, or income levels. It would be universal,
    meaning that everyone who is part of the system, from the most impoverished to
    the wealthiest, would receive the same amount money.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The biggest glaring problem with implementing UBI is figuring out how to fund
    it. In the United States, individual income taxes are the primary source of government
    revenue. However, this situation would create a circular problem where taxes come
    from income, and income comes from taxes. Attempting to adjust the taxation system
    to cover UBI for both workers and non-workers would put an unsustainable burden
    on those still employed, who may feel understandably resentful. Moreover, as AI
    systems increasingly replace human jobs, the shrinking workforce would struggle
    to bear the growing weight of funding the entire system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This issue of a shrinking base of income tax payers will be a pressing concern,
    irrespective of UBI. As jobs are taken over by AI income tax revenue will shrink,
    while simultaneously the number of people needing assistance will grow. Continually
    increasing taxes on those who would still have jobs would not be sustainable.

    option, even for the cold hearted. Not only would it be grossly unfair, inhumane,
    and reprehensible, it would also not be politically stable. If those people who
    end up directly benefiting from AI automation cavalierly tell those who don’t
    to “go eat cake” then they probably should probably expect a violent backlash
    similar to the one that has become linked to that phrase.

    without jobs. The current unemployment and welfare systems are inadequate, plagued
    by huge bureaucracies and irrational penalties for working. Even if these support
    systems were effective, they would still rely on a shrinking tax base, which is
    unsustainable and would only perpetuate the problem. Therefore, we need to explore
    alternative solutions that can support people without jobs, and how to fund them
    from sustainable sources.

    address the shrinking income tax base. While sales taxes can be regressive, meaning
    that people with less money tend to pay a larger fraction of their income relative
    to those with more money, a well-designed tax can mitigate this effect. For instance,
    exemptions for essential items like groceries, medical expenses, and housing could
    ensure that a sales tax is more progressive. Ideally, profitable corporations
    would bear the brunt of the tax, as they would be the direct beneficiaries of
    AI-driven efficiency. Some might expect that corporations would simply pass the
    cost on to customers, but the benefits of AI-driven productivity should offset
    those costs.

    explicit by designing a tax system that specifically targets the benefits of automation.
    By mildly taxing AI-related cost savings, corporations would still reap the benefits
    of automation while contributing to the broader social good. Importantly, as jobs
    are taken over by AI systems, leaving more people in need of assistance, tax revenues
    would grow instead of shrink.

    is a fundamental goal. Under the current system, people work to produce value,
    and their salary is essentially a slice of that value minus the costs of production.
    The employer also takes a slice as does the government. This leads to a zero-sum
    game where there is a limit to the total value created by a pool workers and trying
    to share the value broadly with those who don’t have jobs invariably leads to
    shrinking the existing slices. With AI work, the costs of production are less
    and there is no employee share.

    the total amount of work done by AI is likely to be much greater than the number
    of human jobs displaced. One reason for this difference is that AI is capable
    of doing things that would be too difficult or dangerous, or conversely too trivial
    or boring for people to do. Another reason is that AI systems can be scaled up
    more easily than a human workforce. This greater base means that AI work could
    be taxed at a much lower rate than we currently tax human work.

    One possible approach is to use a concept called “Human Equivalent Effort Time”
    (HEET), which represents the amount of time a typical human would need to complete
    the same task. With HEET, we could track AI automation not only as it replaces
    human labor, but also as it creates new work opportunities for AI systems. A measurement
    like this would allow us to tax the work done by AI systems in a way that’s fair,
    efficient, and sustainable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and eventually replaces traditional income taxes. This approach would enable continued
    revenue growth as AI systems become faster, more efficient, and easier to scale.
    Unlike human labor, AI systems are relatively inexpensive to maintain and can
    be replicated easily, allowing growth without all the difficulties typically involved
    when trying to hire more people.

    designed to perform specific tasks, without any consciousness or self-awareness.
    Using a sentient AI for most work appears neither necessary nor desirable. An
    amusing illustration of this point is from the TV show [Rick and Morty](https://www.adultswim.com/videos/rick-and-morty),
    where a character creates [a sentient robot just to pass butter at the breakfast
    table](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ht-ZyJOV2k). The robot experiences an
    existential crisis and sadness when it realizes its purpose is so trivial. While
    humorous, it nevertheless demonstrates potential pitfalls of creating sentient
    AI just for work tasks.
  prefs: []

    faced with tasks that are monotonous or of little value. Unnecessarily replicating
    that experience with our machines seems pointless and cruel. The vast majority
    tasks can be accomplished without self-awareness, and there’s no need to create
    complex artificial life to perform them. (Which is a good thing because we don’t
    currently know how to make self-aware software.) Machines with no sentience do
    not need a slice of the value they create beyond their operating costs.

    impossible. We know a lot about human workers and what they are capable of and
    that knowledge could be applied to assessing any task performed by an AI system
    and estimating how much time a human would take to do it or something similar.
    Making that determination for the millions of tasks that AI will be used for sounds
    tedious, but it’s also something that could be automated by AI systems. One could
    imagine that instead of reporting how much a company paid in payroll and taxing
    that payroll, companies would instead report how much HEET was done by their software
    and pay a tax on that.
  prefs: []

    of work done, assign an amount of HEET, and access a tax. As with today’s tax
    systems, this would require some honesty and also some penalties for lying. People
    would not enjoy the process and there would likely be frequent appeals of the
    assessment. People would intentionally or by error fail to report work, and everyone
    would probably continue to hate the IRS. In other words, it would not be that
    different from today’s taxation. We would be trading one frustrating bureaucratic
    tax system for another, with the key difference being that this new one would
    tax rapidly growing AI-driven productivity rather than dwindling personal income.

    and that it would stifle innovation and growth. However, that objection doesn’t
    really stand up to scrutiny. Today, a large company wanting work done must hire
    someone which requires paying the person and paying taxes. If AI systems are doing
    the work and being taxed, then there is no salary to pay and the amount of taxation
    could be much smaller than what they would otherwise pay in payroll and payroll
    taxes. For example, instead of paying an employee $50K, plus $10K in payroll taxes
    (and hopefully some amount for benefits) to get one human unit of work done, a
    company might instead deploy ten human-equivalent AI systems, paying $1K in taxes
    for each, thus getting 10x the work done for 1/6th the total cost while the government
    still collects the same amount in taxes.

    where labor is needed but they can’t afford to pay for human staffing. For these

    to new competition. However, the system could be designed to avoid this problem.

    and personal use could both be exempted from HEET tax. To avoid a sudden cost
    shock, the tax could ramp up between $1 million and $2 million gross annual revenue,
    allowing these businesses to adjust to the new tax gradually without being overwhelmed
    by the burden. One could imagine a carefully thought out system with other appropriate
    exemptions.

    AI systems and those AI systems are going to be very productive. AI systems won’t
    take sick days. An AI run factory will not need to have space devoted to safe
    places for humans to stand and it can run 24/7\. An AI accounting service won’t
    need to spend money on office space, HR, or training. If you have an enterprise
    staffed by AI and you want to expand, you just need to buy some more computers
    or maybe some more robots. The majority of the multitude of things that limit
    human productivity do not apply to AI systems. This bounty of savings is what

    However, people without jobs who are financially secure often find that they’re
    able to pursue their passions without the stress of needing to earn a living.

    time is fundamentally different. In the past, technological advances made human
    work more efficient. Instead of spending hundreds of person hours to dig a hole,
    one person with a steam-shovel could dig it in a couple hours. Rather than painstakingly
    building something one at a time by hand, the same number of workers in a factory
    could churn out hundreds every hour. However, you still needed people. Now consider
    a factory with no people, or construction equipment that drives and operates itself.
    Production with zero people is only possible because AI systems can make operational
    decisions and handle exceptions on their own.

    of details that need figuring out. Also, there may be much better ideas that I’ve
    overlooked, both for funding and for distributing support. A national sales tax
