    of the issue at hand? I remember it vividly when I first came across Zhamak Dehghani’s
    [original blog post](https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-monolith-to-mesh.html)
    approximately four years ago (she had written it back in 2019).

    and well thought-out. Additionally to the analysis itself, she also proposed a
    solution to address the described issues, naming it „Data Mesh“, which subsequently
    gained significant traction within the data engineering community. Her sociotechnical
    approach is based on these four interacting principles:'

    I can highlight much of what Zhamak discusses. The article and the follow-up book
    recognized a lot of the problems that I’m still…
