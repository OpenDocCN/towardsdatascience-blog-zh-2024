- en: Over 200 years ago, French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace recognized that
    most problems we face are inherently probabilistic and that most of our knowledge
    is based on probabilities rather than absolute certainties. With this premise,
    he fully developed Bayes‚Äô theorem, a fundamental theory of probability, without
    being aware that the English Reverend Thomas Bayes (also a statistician and philosopher)
    had described the theorem sixty years ago. The theorem, therefore, was named after
    Bayes, although Laplace did most of the mathematical work to complete it.

    only in recent decades, finding a prominent surge in its applications in diverse
    disciplines, with the growing realization that the theorem more closely aligns
    with our perception and cognitive processes. It manifests the dynamic adjustment
    of probabilities informed by both new data and pre-existing knowledge. Moreover,
    it explains the iterative and evolving nature of our‚Ä¶
