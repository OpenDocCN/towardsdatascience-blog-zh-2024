This is affected by the composition of your pay package (salary vs. equity (illiquid private company-stock vs. liquid public company stock)) and the stage of the company.</p><p id="8bc7" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk"><strong class="ne fr">Here is how you can think about it at a high level:</strong></p><ul class=""><li id="6891" class="nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx pz qa qb bk"><strong class="ne fr">Early-stage: </strong>Small startups will offer you lower base salaries and try to make up for that by promising high equity upside. But betting on the equity upside of an early-stage startup is like playing roulette. You might hit it big and never have to work again, but you need to be <em class="pd">very </em>lucky; the vast majority of startups fail, and very few turn into unicorns.</li><li id="1f2a" class="nc nd fq ne b go qc ng nh gr qd nj nk nl qe nn no np qf nr ns nt qg nv nw nx pz qa qb bk"><strong class="ne fr">Big Tech:</strong> Compensation in big tech companies, on the other hand, is more predictable. The base salary is higher (e.g. see the <a class="af oz" href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/2016-data-science-salary-survey-results/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">O’Reilly 2016 Data Science Salary Survey</a>) and the equity is typically liquid (i.e. you can sell it as soon as it vests) and less volatile. This is a big advantage since in pre-IPO companies you might have to wait years for your equity to actually be worth something.</li><li id="1a85" class="nc nd fq ne b go qc ng nh gr qd nj nk nl qe nn no np qf nr ns nt qg nv nw nx pz qa qb bk"><strong class="ne fr">Growth stage:</strong> Growth stage companies can be an interesting compromise; they have a much higher chance of exiting successfully, but your equity still has a lot of upside. If you join 2–3 top-tier growth stage companies over the years, there is a good chance you’ll end up with at least one solid financial outcome. Pay in some of these companies can be very competitive; my compensation actually increased when I moved from Meta to Rippling.</li></ul><p id="ae89" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk"><strong class="ne fr">TL;DR: Instead of just focusing on salary, choose the pay package that fits your appetite for risk and liquidity needs.</strong></p><h1 id="e398" class="ny nz fq bf oa ob oc gq od oe of gt og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot bk">Factor #4: How much risk you’ll take on</h1><p id="cd87" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go ou ng nh gr ov nj nk nl ow nn no np ox nr ns nt oy nv nw nx fj bk">We all want job security.</p><p id="a553" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">We might not stay in a job for our entire career, but at least we want to be able to choose ourselves when we leave.</p><p id="2858" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">Startups are inherently riskier than big companies. Is the founder up to the job? Will you be able to raise another round of financing? Most of these risks are existential; in other words, the earlier the stage of the company you join, the more likely it is it won’t exist anymore 6–12 months from now.</p><figure class="mm mn mo mp mq mr mj mk paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="ms mt ed mu bh mv"><div class="mj mk qh"><img src="../Images/4da899f2690dda2a36e248bef0c3546b.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*mP8TpUisNX19DDcHt-ZZrQ.png"/></div></div><figcaption class="mx my mz mj mk na nb bf b bg z dx">Image by author</figcaption></figure><p id="9a2d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">At companies in later stages, some of these risks have already been eliminated or at least reduced.</p><p id="3c56" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">In exchange, you’re adding another risk, though: Increased layoff risk. Startups only hire for positions that are business critical since they are strapped for cash. If you get hired, you can be sure they really needed another Data Scientist and there is plenty of work for you to do that is considered central to the startup’s success.</p><p id="f5f5" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">In large companies, though, hiring is often less tightly controlled, so there is a higher risk you’ll be hired into a role that is later deemed “non-essential” and you will be part of sweeping layoffs.</p><p id="1ce4" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk"><strong class="ne fr">TL;DR: The earlier the company stage, the more risk you take on.

For example, if you join as the first data hire in a startup, you’ll likely act as part Data Engineer, part Data Analyst and part Data Scientist. You’ll need to figure out how to build out the data infrastructure, make data available to business users, define metrics, run experiments, build dashboards, etc.</p><p id="4a9e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">Your work will also likely range across the entire business, so you might work with Marketing &amp; Sales data one day, and with Customer Support data the next.</p><p id="93b6" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">In a large company, you’ll have a narrowly defined scope.

In a large company, you have a narrow scope, but you get to develop deep subject matter expertise in one particular area; if this expertise is in high demand, specializing like this can be a very lucrative path. In addition, anything you do touches millions or even billions of users.</p><p id="5896" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk"><strong class="ne fr">TL;DR: If you want variety, join a startup.

Where do you even start?</p><p id="cc29" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">But in my experience, working on a variety of challenging problems is the best way to learn about how a business works and build out your hard and soft skills. For example, coming out of school my SQL was basic at best, but being thrown into the deep end at UberEats forced me to become good at it within weeks.</p><p id="f282" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">The major downside of this is that you don’t learn many best practices. What does a best-in-class data infrastructure look like? How do the best companies design their metrics? How do you execute thousands of experiments in a frictionless way while maintaining rigor? Even if you ultimately want to join a startup, seeing what “good” looks like can be helpful so you know what you’re building towards.</p><p id="bab4" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">In addition, large companies often have formalized training.

But what about your growth within the company?</p><p id="fee1" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">At an early-stage company, your growth opportunities come as a direct result of the growth of the company. If you join as an early data hire and you and the company are both doing well, it’s likely you’ll get to build out and lead a data team.</p><p id="7a71" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">Most of the young VPs and C-Level executives you see got there because their careers were accelerated by joining a “rocket ship” company.</p><p id="90b4" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">There is a big benefit of larger companies, though: You typically have a broader range of career options.
