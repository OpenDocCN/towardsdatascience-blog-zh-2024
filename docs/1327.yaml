    father of modern management, in 1954\. It is an often quoted saying which is actually
    part of a larger, and I think more powerful quote “What gets measured gets managed
    — even when it’s pointless to measure and manage it, and even if it harms the
    purpose of the organization to do so.”
  prefs: []

- en: Drucker’s insight underscores that, while gathering and measuring data is essential,
    the real challenge lies in identifying and prioritizing the right metrics that
    will drive a business in the right direction. By focusing on and prioritizing
    the right metrics, you can ensure that what gets measured and managed is truly
    impactful.

- en: The most important metrics for a company change over time. Uber was not profitable
    for around 15 years, yet the company is considered one of the most successful
    businesses in recent time. Why? Uber focused intensely on rapid growth in its
    initial years rather than immediate profitability. The company prioritized metrics
    like user growth and user retention to establish a dominant presence in the ride-sharing
    market. Then, once Uber became the dominant ride-sharing company, its focus shifted
    towards profitability and financial sustainability. It, like many others, anchored
    their metrics to the stages of the product lifecycle.

    stage, where the primary focus is on achieving product-market-fit. At this stage,
    product owners must determine whether their product meets a genuine market need
    and resonates with the target audience. Understanding product-market-fit involves
    assessing whether early adopters are not only using the product but also finding
    value in it. Being confident in product-market-fit sets the foundation for future
    growth and scalability.

    in 10 days” rule. By using funnel analysis and experimentation, Facebook discovered
    that new users who connected with at least 8 friends within their first 10 days
    were far more likely to remain active on the platform. This insight led to focused
    efforts on optimizing user onboarding and encouraging friend connections, significantly

    to instrument every page and every button in a product, but this can often be
    onerous for engineering to implement and difficult to maintain. Instead, start
    with just a beginning and end event — these two events will allow you to calculate
    a conversion rate and a time to convert. Expand beyond two events to only include
    critical steps in a user journey. Ensure that events capture user segments such
    as device, operating system and location.

    this capability early in a product and company’s lifecycle because it is more
    difficult to implement than a set of metrics. Build the muscle by involving product,
    engineering and data teams in experiment design. Experimentation is not only crucial
    in ‘Stage 2 — Growth’ but should remain a fundamental part of analytics throughout
    the rest of the product lifecycle.

    are the key interactions where users realize the product’s value, leading to loyalty
    and stickiness. Facebook’s 8 friends in 10 days was their users ‘aha’ moment.
    This analysis requires analysts to explore a variety of potential characteristics
    and can be difficult to identify and distil down to a simple ‘aha’ moment. Be

    advertising spend, reducing time to close sales deals through to cross-selling
    and bundling products for existing users. Broadly, a LTV:CAC ratio of 3:1 to 4:1

    These users are the highest priority to retain, and have the product-usage behavior
    that would ideally be shared across all users. Look for users active every day,
    who spend long periods of time in the product, who use the most features and who
    spend the most. Deploy measures, such as loyalty programs, to retain these users
    and identify pathways to increase the number of power users.
