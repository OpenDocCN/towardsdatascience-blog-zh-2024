It’s using the OpenAI API to generate Python code based on a given prompt.\n\nThink of it as giving our agent the ability to brainstorm and write code on the fly. We’re also doing some cleanup to ensure we get clean, executable Python code without any markdown formatting or unnecessary comments.\n\nThe parameters we’re using (like temperature and top_p) allow us to control the creativity and randomness of the generated code. It’s like adjusting the “inspiration” knob on our AI’s imagination!\n\n**Step 3: Library Management — Equipping Our Agent with the Right Tools**\n\nEvery good coder knows the importance of having the right libraries at their disposal. Our AI assistant is no different. This next method allows AgentPro to identify and install any necessary Python libraries\n\n```", "```py\n\nThis method is like sending our agent on a shopping spree in the Python Package Index. It scans the generated code for any pip install comments, checks if the libraries are already installed, and if not, installs them.

It takes the generated code, writes it to a temporary file, executes it, captures the output (or any errors), and then cleans up after itself.
