- en: Forecasting is one of the most important use cases across all industries. One
    example is the retail industry. Several planning activities require predicting
    capabilities, and these contribute to optimizing margin, e.g., financial, production,
    or workforce planning. This can impact stock management, for instance, waste and
    leftovers or stockouts, customer service levels, and overall decision-making.

    requires a deep understanding of state-of-the-art (SOTA) forecasting methodologies.
    At the same time, it requires specific business domain knowledge to which they
    are applied. These two factors have been motivating the increasing interest in
    pre-trained models — they reduce the need for highly custom setups. Adding that
    motivation to the success of large pre-trained models in the Natural Language
    Processing (NLP) community, a.k.a. Large Language Models (LLMs), we have a research
    path with many contributors.
