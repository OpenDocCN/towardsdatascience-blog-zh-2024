    cacao in the Amazon basin, to chocolatiers sculpting edible art in the mountains
    of Switzerland, and enormous factories in Hershey, Pennsylvania churning out 70
    million kisses per day, the nuanced forms and flavors of chocolate have been integrated
    into many cultures and their customs. While quality can greatly vary across chocolate
    products, a well-known, shelf-stable, easily shareable form of chocolate are M&Ms.
    Readily found by convenience store check-out counters and in hotel vending machines,
    the brightly colored pellets are a popular treat whose packaging is re-branded
    to fit nearly any commercializable American holiday.

    States. While I recognized that fancy European chocolate is indeed quite tasty
    and often superior to American chocolate, it was unclear to me if the same claim
    should hold for M&Ms. I learned that many Europeans perceive an “unpleasant” or
    “tangy” taste in American chocolate, which is largely attributed to [butyric acid](https://www.chemistryworld.com/podcasts/butyric-acid/1017662.article),
    a compound resulting from differences in how milk is treated before incorporation

    international scientists pursuing cutting-edge research in biosustainability,
    I was inspired to break out my data science toolbox and investigate this M&M flavor

    taste responses and report the percentage of each response received by each M&M
    type. M&Ms from Denmark more frequently received “Good” responses than USA M&Ms
    but also more frequently received “Bad” responses. M&Ms from the USA were most
    frequently reported to taste “Normal” (Figure 2). This may result from the elevated
    number of participants hailing from North America, where the USA M&M is the default
    and thus more “Normal,” while the Denmark M&M was more often perceived as better
    or worse than the baseline.

    that there is no difference between the two M&Ms, we found the *p*-value for the

    fall quite neutrally around 0, others strongly prefer the familiar USA M&M, while
    a handful moderately prefer Denmark M&Ms. Anecdotally, North Americans who learned
    their preference skewed towards European M&Ms displayed signals of inflated pride,
    as if their results signaled posh refinement.'

    a possibly significant difference in the means between European and North American
    participants (***p* = 0.049**), but come on, this is like the 20th p-value I’ve
    reported — this one is probably too close to call.

    responses, while higher values indicate more inconsistent responses. Figure made

    M&M type differently across the 5 samples. This would be expected if the taste
    difference between European-sourced and American-sourced M&Ms is not actually
    all that perceptible. Most inconsistent were participants who gave the same M&M
    type “Good”, “Normal”, *and* “Bad” responses (e.g., points high on the y-axis,
    with wider standard deviations of taste scores), indicating lower taste perception
    abilities.

    consistent: they reported the same taste response for each of the 5 M&Ms from
    each M&M type, resulting in an average standard deviation of 0.0 (bottom of Figure
    9). Excluding the one of the four who simply rated all 10 M&Ms as “Normal”, the
    other three appeared to be “Perfect Classifiers” — either rating all M&Ms of one
    type “Good” and the other “Normal”, or rating all M&Ms of one type “Normal” and
    the other “Bad.” Perhaps these folks are “super tasters.”'

- en: Another possible explanation for the inconsistency in individual taste responses
    is that there exists a perceptible taste difference based on the M&M color. Visually,
    the USA M&Ms were noticeably more smooth and vibrant than the Denmark M&Ms, which
    were somewhat more “splotchy” in appearance (Figure 10A). M&M color was recorded
    during the experiment, and although balanced sampling was not formally built into
    the experimental design, colors seemed to be sampled roughly evenly, with the
    exception of Blue USA M&Ms, which were oversampled (Figure 10B).

    a bit hard to perceive on screen in my unprofessionally lit photo, but with the
    naked eye, USA M&Ms seemed to be brighter and more uniformly colored while Denmark
    M&Ms have a duller and more mottled color. Is it just me, or can you already hear
    the Europeans saying “They are brighter because of all those extra chemicals you
    put in your food that we ban here!” **B.** Distribution of M&Ms of each color

    (Figure 11), however we do not believe there are enough data to support firm conclusions.
    After all, on average each participant would likely only taste 5 of the 6 M&M
    colors once, and 1 color not at all. We leave further M&M color investigations
    to future work.

    and that all feelings are valid. While some participants took this to heart and
    occasionally spent over a minute deeply savoring each M&M and evaluating it as
    if they were a sommelier, many participants seemed to view the experiment as a
    competition (which occasionally led to deflated or inflated pride). Experimenters
    wrote down quotes and notes in conjunction with M&M responses, some of which were
    a bit “colorful.” We provide a hastily rendered word cloud for each M&M type for
    entertainment purposes (Figure 12) though we caution against reading too far into
    them without diligent sentiment analysis.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Overall, there does not appear to be a “global consensus” that European M&Ms
    are better than American M&Ms. However, European participants tended to more strongly
    express negative reactions to USA M&Ms while North American participants seemed
    relatively split on whether they preferred M&Ms sourced from the USA vs from Europe.
    The preference trends of Asian participants often fell somewhere between the North
    Americans and Europeans.

- en: Therefore, I’ll admit that it’s probable that Europeans are not engaged in a
    grand coordinated lie about M&Ms. The skew of most European participants towards
    Denmark M&Ms is compelling, especially since I was the experimenter who personally
    collected much of the taste response data. If they found a way to cheat, it was
    done well enough to exceed my own passive perception such that I didn’t notice.
    However, based on this study, it would appear that a strongly negative “vomit
    flavor” is not universally perceived and does not become apparent to non-Europeans
    when tasting both M&Ms types side by side.

    of this work with improved participant sampling, additional M&M types sourced
    from other continents, and deeper investigations into possible taste differences
    due to color.
