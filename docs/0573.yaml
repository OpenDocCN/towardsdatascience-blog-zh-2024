    For those who don’t know, Tableau is software (paid, but with a trial or even
    free version for students and teachers) that allows you to **explore and visualize
    data**. At first glance, it is a very complex software, because it allows you
    to do many things, including creating single more or less complex **graphs**,
    **dashboards**, and **stories**. You can’t find a lot of resources explaining
    how to do this or that in Tableau. There are tons of books, courses, people to
    follow on LinkedIn, etc. I’m not here to list my favorites, but if you’re interested,
    leave a comment at the end of this article or contact me privately on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angelicaloduca/).

    this fearless journey into the world of Tableau.
