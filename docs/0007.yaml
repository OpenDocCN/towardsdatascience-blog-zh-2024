    clinical practice and the prevailing objectives of AI researchers and companies.
    This is, of course, just a personal opinion and not a critique of the current
    R&D processes, but it is a reflection grounded on some experience in both fields.

    However, we must acknowledge that AI in healthcare is an entirely different animal;
    the degree of complexity, regulation, and risk is significantly higher than that
    of most other applications. Also, publicly available datasets are orders of magnitude
    scarcer than in many other domains due to privacy and accessibility limits.

    without answering a fundamental question. On one side, we can find amusing representations
    of this concept, such as the [“That’s what she said” joke identifier](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~brun/pubs/pubs/Kiddon11.pdf)
    (an amusing solution, I’m not criticizing); and, on the other, examples where
    the forced implementation of complex deep learning workflows is [expensive and
    unnecessary](https://thedailywtf.com/articles/No%2c_We_Need_a_Neural_Network).

    calculation. In brief, “*Let’s find a big and profitable field in healthcare,
    and let’s jam-pack it with AI.*” As always, it might be a great short-term strategy,
    but the magic disappears after a while.

    often revert to conventional practices when the advantages of the new solution
    are not evident. Planck’s principle can be safely applied to medical innovation,
    “*science advances one funeral at a time*.” For this reason, a 5–10% increase
    in operational efficiency, while significant at scale, is hardly applied in the
    medical setting— we need a 2x-10x improvement in areas relevant to everyday clinical
    practice.

    fields into semi-insulated compartments. The successful integration of molecular
    biology within the medical field is a precedent, suggesting a similar potential

    approach is crucial for catalyzing real-life developments in patient care.
