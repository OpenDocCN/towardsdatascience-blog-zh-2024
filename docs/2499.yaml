    for data engineering. The Python-based tool allows you to **define**, **schedule**,
    and **monitor** your data pipelines. Prefect is a great tool for data engineers
    and scientists who want to automate their **data pipelines**.'

    for Your Data](https://medium.com/@broepke/getting-started-with-prefect-powerful-orchestration-for-your-data-20ef827b20d5),
    I wrote about deploying Prefect to AWS EC2 to run what they called an Agent, which
    essentially ran a job after it was kicked off.'

- en: With the upgrade to [Version 3.0](https://www.prefect.io/blog/introducing-prefect-3-0),
    Prefect is retiring the longstanding Agent model in favor of a new architecture
    called Workers. The upgrade from v2 to v3 instantly broke my deployments, leaving
    me needing to figure out an alternative.

- en: Workers are tighter integrated with the infrastructure they run on. This is
    a fabulous improvement because, in the past, you needed to figure out how to host
    the Agent on your computer. It was like installing software on a classic hosted
    server and maintaining it to OS updates.
