- en: It’s not a secret that many vacancies in IT & data are remote. On one hand,
    this means not wasting time in traffic jams on the way to work and back home.
    But on the other hand, for many employees the office atmosphere allows them to
    get organized and be ready for productive work.

    to feel themselves more inclusive in a team. They are 100% based on my very own
    experience of working remotely as Data Analyst & IT specialist for 2.5+ years.

    includes work hours, break for lunch, and time for social interactions. This can
    help you stay productive and maintain a sense of doing your job by design in a
    thorough manner.

    are intensive tasks like working on the most important projects or starting new
    ones from scratch. Besides that, I also try to include in my ‘before-afternoon-routine’
    at least one unpleasant small task (a.k.a a frog) that doesn’t eat too much time,
    but requires your involvement.

    routine) — for instance, you get an immediate request to connect with clients
    right now or one of your colleagues suddenly falls ill. Trust me, it’s not an
    extraordinary case at all, especially for long-lasting and complex projects. In
    such situations, try to solve these issues and then get back to your normal daily
    routine without outliers as soon as possible.

    becomes a must for remote collective. Make a habit to regularly communicate with
    your colleagues via work chats or using video calls. This can help you feel connected
    to your team and reduce feelings of isolation.

    meetings, during which we share not only professional updates about the projects
    we are working on, but also some personal issues, e.g. how we spent the weekend
    or recommendations on what films to watch or what museums and concerts to go to.

    work, e.g. strategical sessions, town halls (every second week), or just quizzes.
    This helps to learn more about your team (their tastes and preferences), as well
    as to maintain team spirit (the latter significantly ease the common work with
    people who work from different parts of the world on challenging projects).

- en: In addition to a lunch break, don’t forget to schedule regular breaks throughout
    your day to step away from your work and recharge. Use this time to go for a walk
    (at least to your closest window), do some stretching exercises, or engage in
    a hobby to split up the monotony of remote work.

    breaks will allow you to avoid burnouts and return to the current task with fresh
    mind (for some data-related tasks this can be a game changer). Very often this
    approach allows me to look at the challenging projects under a bit different angles
    and solve them more effectively.

    work, although in a case of working remotely this might be quite tricky. Being
    loyal to your company is important, but don’t underestimate a creation of your
    own personal brand and reputation by joining similar groups of people.

    to consider both communities within your company (not necessary virtual ones!),
    as well as other groups of like-minded individuals, for instance those who are
    also working remotely or belong to IT sphere [2, 3]. Doing so will give you a
    sense of camaraderie and support, as well as opportunities for networking and
    socializing.

    crucial to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Create a designated workspace,
    set specific work hours, and make time for activities outside of work to avoid
    feeling isolated.

    project (trust me, it’s smarter than missing deadlines on an endless number of
    projects for which you “kindly” said “Yes”), but rather about a necessity to clear
    draw red lines which it is better not to go beyond to anyone from your team. For
    instance, not having any communication with colleagues during non-working hours
    / at night / during vacations. Doing so you will feel yourself much more relaxed
    and balanced, while helping others to respect your honesty and a sober look at
    your capabilities.

    a healthy work-life balance. By following the advice of establishing a routine,
    communicating with colleagues effectively, setting up a dedicated workspace, taking
    breaks, and prioritizing self-care, we can create a conducive environment for
    remote work success. This is especially important for getting better conditions
    for those working in IT & data, where focus and concentration are essential for
    writing high-quality code.
