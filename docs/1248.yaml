- en: One of a Data Scientist’s worst nightmares is data leakage. And why is data
    leakage so harmful? **Because the ways your models may suffer from it are designed
    to convince you that your model is excellent and that you should be expecting
    awesome results in the future.**

- en: As you may know, the primary goal of every machine learning model is to generalize
    the patterns it learns for the future data. As we can’t really access future data
    (without making a time machine first), the best way to simulate this during model
    development is to set aside a test and a validation set to be used to assess model
    performance.

- en: During development, data scientists aim to improve the model’s test and validation
    performance. If results are satisfactory, then data scientists assume that their
    models are ready for production. And that’s why data leakage is so dangerous.
    As it’s able to hide itself in seemingly innocent behaviors, it can lurk in the
    background, waiting for you to put that model into production and just find out
    that the performance in real life is way worse than the one on the test set.
