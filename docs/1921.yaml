    Each failure taught me valuable lessons which eventually landed me my dream job

    and typical questions, but I have found that they often fall short in guiding

    true responsibilities of a role from its job description. I once interviewed for
    a position at a self-driving car company where the focus was heavily on computer
    vision and sensor fusion. Despite my strong background in general ML algorithms,
    I was unprepared for specific questions about convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
    and kernel functions. This experience taught me the importance of understanding
    the hidden requirements within job descriptions.

    understand the 4 different types of ML rounds.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**ML Fundamentals/Breadth**: This round assesses an engineer’s understanding
    of ML fundamentals across various topics. It’s often a rapid-fire session where
    interviewers may jump between different topics or might ask general questions
    within an area.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**ML Case Study / Depth**: This round focuses on specialized topics and detailed
    case studies, from your past projects and/or specific domain knowledge. This round
    is particularly interesting and the most open-ended of all interview types and
    generally aimed for above entry-level jobs with some experience.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**ML System Design**: This round resembles a typical software engineering system
    design interview, applying similar principles. You are given a product space (e.g.,
    designing a YouTube recommendation ML system) and asked to define the problem,
    outline the design process, and communicate your thoughts including tradeoffs.
    Interviewers look for your problem-solving approach, thought process, and high-level
    design skills.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL

    in ML breadth, practicing coding for basic models.'

    — a topic I hadn’t prepared for since my background was in NLP and classification
    problems. In hindsight, it was clear that, given the company’s focus on house
    sales and price predictions, regression problems were common.
