    models, training and/or fine-tuning them and then using them for prediction (i.e.
    inference). Now imagine that we would like to move beyond just offline experimentation
    and provide our customers access to our amazing models so that they also can use
    them for prediction. In such cases, we can “deploy” our model to a SageMaker “endpoint”.
    Then our customers can send their requests to the deployed endpoint and receive
    real-time predictions. These endpoints provide certain benefits, including:'

    deployed). Therefore, we can use it just like any other web address where we can
    send the request (i.e. payload) and receive a response (i.e. model prediction).'

    the necessary computational resources to serve our customers. For example, let’s
    say my laptop is only capable of processing 10 requests per second but I expect
    to have 10,000 customer requests per second. AWS will scale up the endpoint and
    provision enough hardware to support all 10,000…'
