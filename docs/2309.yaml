    I described how you can access your personal data that is stored and used by the
    front-line, consumer-facing companies that we engage with every day. These include
    retailers, social media, cell providers, financial service firms, and many others.
    I explored how to use various machine learning models and visualizations to discover
    how those companies perceive you.

    firms frequently share our personal data with another set of companies generally
    known as data brokers or data aggregators (hereafter referred to aggregators).
    Aggregators enhance our data with other types of data sourced from public records,
    other aggregators, and similar sources to create profiles of us. They then sell
    the profiles back to consumer-facing companies and other organizations for marketing
    or other purposes.

    about me? How many features do they store? Are there major types of data that
    individual aggregators focus on? And if there are, what does that tell me about
    their end-customers? What industries are those end-customers in, and what personal
    data do…'
