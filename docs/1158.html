To put it simply, the LLM behaves like a pupil with a very rich dictionary who tries to pretend that they’ve studied for the exam and know all the answers, but they actually don’t! They just pretend to be intelligent due to the vast information at their disposal, but their ability to reason using this information is very limited. I would even go a step further and say that:</p><blockquote class="pi pj pk"><p id="3900" class="mj mk pl ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">The so-called Artificial Intelligence (AI) is very often Artificial Imitation of Intelligence (AII).

Good evidence of it being “specialist” is the amount of contextual information that has to be provided to the average person in order to understand the topic:</p><ol class=""><li id="1fa8" class="mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne pm pb pc bk">Banks are subject to regulatory Capital requirements.</li><li id="cf28" class="mj mk fq ml b go pd mn mo gr pe mq mr ms pf mu mv mw pg my mz na ph nc nd ne pm pb pc bk">Capital can be considered a buffer which absorbs financial losses.</li><li id="2350" class="mj mk fq ml b go pd mn mo gr pe mq mr ms pf mu mv mw pg my mz na ph nc nd ne pm pb pc bk">The requirements to hold Capital, ensures that banks have sufficient capability to absorb losses reducing the likelihood of bankruptcy and financial crisis.</li><li id="8e4f" class="mj mk fq ml b go pd mn mo gr pe mq mr ms pf mu mv mw pg my mz na ph nc nd ne pm pb pc bk">The rules for setting the requirements in 1. are based on risk-proportionality principles:<br/><strong class="ml fr">→ </strong>the riskier the business that banks undertake<br/><strong class="ml fr">→</strong> higher risk-weights<br/><strong class="ml fr">→ </strong>higher capital requirements<br/><strong class="ml fr">→ </strong>larger loss buffer<br/><strong class="ml fr">→ </strong>stable bank</li><li id="2d78" class="mj mk fq ml b go pd mn mo gr pe mq mr ms pf mu mv mw pg my mz na ph nc nd ne pm pb pc bk">The degree of riskiness in 4. is often measured in the form of credit rating of the firms with which the bank does business.</li><li id="af78" class="mj mk fq ml b go pd mn mo gr pe mq mr ms pf mu mv mw pg my mz na ph nc nd ne pm pb pc bk">Credit ratings come from different agencies and in different formats.</li><li id="61c1" class="mj mk fq ml b go pd mn mo gr pe mq mr ms pf mu mv mw pg my mz na ph nc nd ne pm pb pc bk">In order to standardise the ratings, regulators have created mapping rules from every rating format to the standardised Credit Quality Step (CQS) in the range of 1 to 6.</li><li id="e790" class="mj mk fq ml b go pd mn mo gr pe mq mr ms pf mu mv mw pg my mz na ph nc nd ne pm pb pc bk">Then the regulatory rules for determining the risk-weights in 4. are based on the CQS.</li><li id="33c1" class="mj mk fq ml b go pd mn mo gr pe mq mr ms pf mu mv mw pg my mz na ph nc nd ne pm pb pc bk">The rules in 8. for European banks are set in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR).</li></ol><p id="d6a2" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">The topic in the 9 statements above seems complex and it really is, there are dozens of additional complications and cases that exist, but which I’ve avoided on purpose, as they are not even necessary for illustrating the struggle of AII with such topics.

In an ontology, we can also define many actual instances of individual Birds with their own properties = <strong class="ml fr">data</strong>. Finally, we can also add <strong class="ml fr">logic</strong> (e.g. If a Bird &lt;eats&gt; more than 5 Seeds, then &lt;it is&gt; not Hungry). This is essentially making the data “smart” by incorporating some of the logic as data itself, thus making it a reusable knowledge.

Do we need code and business documentation, if the former can be generated directly from the natural language specification of the business problem, and the latter can be generated in the form of natural language definition of the logic by the explainer?</p></blockquote><h1 id="e3d5" class="nz oa fq bf ob oc od gq oe of og gt oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou bk">Conclusion</h1><p id="b877" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go ov mn mo gr ow mq mr ms ox mu mv mw oy my mz na oz nc nd ne fj bk">Imagine a world in which all banking regulations are provided centrally by the regulator not in the form of text but in the form of an ontology or smart data, that includes all structure and logic. While individual banks import the central ontology and extend it with their own data, thus automatically evaluating all rules and requirements. This will remove any room for subjectivity and interpretation and ensure a complete audit trail of the results.</p><p id="3dd7" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">Beyond regulations, enterprises can develop their own ontologies in which they encode, automate and reuse the knowledge of their specialists or different calculation methodologies and governance processes. On an enterprise level, such ontology can add value for enforcing a common dictionary and understanding of the rules and reduce effort wasted on interpretations and disagreements which can be redirected to building more knowledge in the form of ontology. The same concept can be applied to any specialist area in which:</p><ul class=""><li id="b23a" class="mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne pa pb pc bk">Text association is not sufficient and LLMs struggle.</li><li id="e0ce" class="mj mk fq ml b go pd mn mo gr pe mq mr ms pf mu mv mw pg my mz na ph nc nd ne pa pb pc bk">Big data for effective ML training is not available.</li><li id="f6aa" class="mj mk fq ml b go pd mn mo gr pe mq mr ms pf mu mv mw pg my mz na ph nc nd ne pa pb pc bk">Highly-qualified specialists can be assisted by real artificial intelligence, reducing costs and risks of mistakes.</li></ul><blockquote class="pi pj pk"><p id="b9e2" class="mj mk pl ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">If data is nowadays deemed as valuable as gold, I believe that the real diamond is structured data, that we can call knowledge. Such knowledge in the form of ontologies and knowledge graphs can also be traded between companies just like data is traded now for marketing purposes. <strong class="ml fr">Who knows, maybe this will evolve into a pay-per-node business model, where expertise in the form of smart data can be sold as a product or service.</strong></p></blockquote><p id="bf42" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">Then we can call intelligence our ability to accumulate knowledge and to query it for getting actionable insights. This can evolve into specialist AIs that tap into ontologies in order to gain expertise in a given field and reduce hallucinations.</p><p id="071e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">LLMs are already making an impact on company profits — <a class="af nf" href="https://www.pymnts.com/buy-now-pay-later/2024/klarna-boosts-profits-with-chatgpt-bnpl-firms-tap-artificial-intelligence/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Klarna is expected to have $40 million improvement on profits</a> as a result of ChatGPT handling most of its customer service chats, reducing the costs for human agents.</p><p id="f736" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">Note however the exact area of application of the LLM! This is not the more specialised fields of financial/product planning or asset and liabilities management of a financial company such as Klarna. It is the general customer support service, which is the entry level position in many companies, which already uses a lot of standardised responses or procedures. The area in which it is easiest to apply AI but also in which the value added might not be the largest. In addition, the risk of LLM hallucination due to lack of real intelligence is still there. Especially in the financial services sector, any form of “financial advice” by the LLM can lead to legal and regulatory repercussions.</p><h1 id="f06f" class="nz oa fq bf ob oc od gq oe of og gt oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou bk">Future ideas</h1><p id="e980" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go ov mn mo gr ow mq mr ms ox mu mv mw oy my mz na oz nc nd ne fj bk">LLMs already utilise knowledge graphs in the so-called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). However, these graphs are generic concepts that might include any data structure and do not necessarily represent ontologies, which use by LLMs is relatively less explored. This gives me the following ideas for next article:</p><ol class=""><li id="8223" class="mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne pm pb pc bk">Use plain English to query the ontology, avoiding reliance on particular CNL syntax — this can be done via NLP model that generates queries to the knowledge graph in which the ontology is stored — <a class="af nf" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kla1c_p5v0w" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">chatting with KGs</a>.</li><li id="9d65" class="mj mk fq ml b go pd mn mo gr pe mq mr ms pf mu mv mw pg my mz na ph nc nd ne pm pb pc bk">Use a more robust way of generating the ontology — the <a class="af nf" href="https://cognipy.org/index.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">CogniPy</a> library was useful for quick illustration, however, for extended use a more proven framework for ontology-oriented programming should be used like <a class="af nf" href="https://owlready2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Owlready2</a>.</li><li id="0ef9" class="mj mk fq ml b go pd mn mo gr pe mq mr ms pf mu mv mw pg my mz na ph nc nd ne pm pb pc bk">Point 1. enables the general user to get information from the ontology without knowing any programming, however, point 2 implies that a software developer is needed for defining and writing to the ontology (which has its pros and cons). However, if we want to close the AI loop, then specialists should be able to define ontologies using natural language and without the need for developers. This will be harder to do, but similar examples already exist: <a class="af nf" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMwa9q6wWkw&amp;t=1s" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">LLM with KG interface</a>, <a class="af nf" rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="/an-introduction-to-entity-resolution-needs-and-challenges-97fba052dde5">entity resolution</a>.</li></ol><p id="02fe" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">A proof of concept that achieves all 3 points above can claim the title of true AI, it should be able to develop knowledge in a smart data structure which is both human and machine readable, and query it via natural language to get actionable insights with complete transparency and audit trail.</p><p id="15ab" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">Follow me for part 2!</p></div></div></div></div>
