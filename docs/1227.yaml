- en: A few years ago, I read a great book called ‘Algorithms to Live By’, written
    by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths. The main concept of the book is that we
    face many of the same types of decision problems in our daily lives that data
    professionals face in their work. No problem do I see more instances of in my
    life than the multi-armed bandit problem. It shows up all over the place!

    bad at fishing — but I still enjoy it. I often find myself wondering which lure
    I should use to catch as many fish as possible. While I’m using one lure, I’m
    always trying to decide if there is another one I should try that could catch
    more fish. This is a multi-armed bandit problem!
