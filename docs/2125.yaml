- en: I discussed SQL User-Defined Functions in my last article. But compared to SQL,
    Python stands out with its versatility in function design. From my experience
    working in tech companies, it’s evident that no data science project can be completed
    without the extensive use of Python functions. Python has become a fundamental
    tool for data scientists to efficiently manage and analyze data, tackle complex
    tasks and deploy product features. With its broad range of functions at the core,
    Python proves to be a powerful tool in the field of data science. However, with
    so many types of functions available, it’s hard and impossible for data scientists
    to be familiar with them all. Today’s article will cover the top 8 types of functions
    commonly used in real-world data science, explaining the intricate logic and mechanisms
    behind them that other tutorials rarely mentioned. This article will also clear
    up the confusion between different types of functions that are often mistaken
    for one another. Finally, a mini project will demonstrate how to effectively apply
    several of these functions in practice.
