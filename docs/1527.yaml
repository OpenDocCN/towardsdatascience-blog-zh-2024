    conclusions, AI relies on its ability to retrieve relevant information, understand
    contexts, and learn from past experiences. This article delves into why memory
    is pivotal for AI, exploring its role in recall, reasoning, and continuous learning.

    as it allows the model to ingest more information. While this is true to an extent,
    our current understanding of how language models prioritize context is still developing.
    In fact, studies have shown that “model performance is highest when when relevant
    information occurs at the beginning or end of its input context.”[[1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.03172)
    The larger a context window, the more likely we are to encounter the infamous
    “lost in the middle” problem, where specific facts or text are not recalled by
    the model due to important information being buried in the middle [[2]](https://dev.to/llmware/why-long-context-windows-for-llms-can-be-deceptive-lost-in-the-middle-problem-oj2).

    When we travel, we passively listen to many announcements including airline advertisements,
    credit card offers, safety briefings, luggage collection details, etc. We may
    not realize how much information we absorb until it is time for us to recall relevant
    pieces. For instance, if a language model that is relying on retrieving relevant
    information to answer a question, rather than its inherent knowledge, is asked
    “What should I do in case of an emergency landing?” it might not be able to recall
    the pertinent details needed to answer this important question because too much
    information is retrieved. However, with a long-term memory, the model can store
    and recall the most critical information, enabling more effective reasoning with
    the proper context.

- en: Memory provides essential context and allows models to understand past problem-solving
    approaches, identifying what worked and what needs improvement. It doesn’t just
    offer important context; it also equips models with the ability to recall the
    methods previously used to solve problems, recognize successful strategies, and
    pinpoint areas needing improvement. This improvement can in turn aid the model’s
    ability to effectively reason about complex multi-step tasks. Without adequate
    reasoning, language models struggle to understand tasks, think logically about
    objectives, solve multistep problems, or utilize appropriate tools. You can read
    more about the importance of reasoning and advanced reasoning techniques in my
    previous article [here](https://medium.com/ai-mind-labs/advanced-language-model-reasoning-pre-training-fine-tuning-and-inference-time-techniques-f5c87ad080f5).

    There are thousands of tables, but because you possess an understanding of what
    data is needed it allows you to focus on a subset. After hours of searching, relevant
    data is found across five different tables. Three months later, when the data
    needs updating, the search process must be repeated but you can’t remember the
    5 source tables you used to create this new report. The manual search process
    repeats again. Without long term memory, a language model might approach the problem
    the same way — with brute force — until it finds the relevant data to complete
    the task. However a language model equipped with long term memory could store
    its initial search plan, a description of each table, and a revised plan based
    on its search findings from each table. When the data needs refreshing, it can
    start from a previously successful approach, improving efficiency and performance.
