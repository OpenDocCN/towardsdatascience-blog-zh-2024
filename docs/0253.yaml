- en: I have been working as a Data Scientist for over two years. Over time, I have
    learned and mainly studied machine learning (ML). To me, it’s probably the most
    fascinating part of the job.

    it one step at a time makes the whole process less daunting and much easier to
    handle.

    of mathematical operations. These algorithms can be implemented through various
    methods and in numerous programming languages, yet their underlying mathematical
    principles are the same.
