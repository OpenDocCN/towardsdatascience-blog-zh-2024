    with a degree in applied mathematics from an engineering schools. At that time,
    data science wasn’t a trendy term. I kicked off my career at EDF (Électricité
    de France), a leader in the energy sector, building models to understand energy
    consumption and production patterns using time series and probabilistic models.'

    it’s still very**…'
