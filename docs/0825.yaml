- en: Causal inference, and specifically causal machine learning, is an indispensable
    tool that can help us make decisions by understanding cause and effect. Optimizing
    prices, reducing customer churn, running targeted ad campaigns, and deciding which
    patients would benefit most from medical treatment are all example use cases for
    causal machine learning.

- en: There are many techniques for causal machine learning problems, but the technique
    that seems to stand out most is known as D[ouble Machine Learning](https://matheusfacure.github.io/python-causality-handbook/22-Debiased-Orthogonal-Machine-Learning.html)
    (DML) or Debiased/Orthogonal Machine Learning. Beyond the empirical success of
    DML, this technique stands out because of its rich theoretical backing rooted
    in a simple theorem from econometrics.

- en: In this article, we’ll unpack the theorem that grounds DML through hands-on
    examples. We’ll discuss the intuition for DML and empirically verify its generality
    on increasingly complex examples. This article is not a tutorial on DML, instead
    it serves as motivation for how DML models see past mere correlation to understand
    and predict cause and effect.
