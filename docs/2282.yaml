    factors that could influence how you ask for feedback: company culture, personal
    fears, an uninvolved manager, past feedback being useless, etc…'

- en: While these might be true, they shouldn’t deter you from asking feedback. As
    a person who leads teams, I have to provide tons of feedback, both on a regular
    basis but also in every performance review. In a previous post, [I describe how
    I provide feedback using the SBIN framework](https://medium.com/@joparga3/sbin-deliver-fair-and-robust-feedback-senior-data-science-lead-ad524063343a).
    I want to lean on this framework to also provide you with a set of template/guidance
    questions which will help you target your feedback, and in return, get a higher
    quality response.
