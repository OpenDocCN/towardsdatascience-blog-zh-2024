    risk. Many people are critical of this idea and think the probability of AI posing
    an existential risk to humanity is tiny. A common pejorative simplification is
    that AI safety researchers are worried about super intelligent AI building human
    killing robots like in the movie Terminator.

    A common example is that we don’t care about an ant colony being destroyed when
    we build a highway — we weren’t hostile to the ants but we simply didn’t care.
    That is to say that our goals are orthogonal to the ants.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each Gridworld is an “environment” in which an agent takes “actions” and is
    given a “reward” for completing a task. The agent must learn through trial and
    error which actions result in the highest reward. A learning algorithm is necessary
    to optimise the agent to complete its task.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At each time step an agent sees the current state of the world and is given
    a series of actions it can take. These actions are limited to walking up, down,
    left, or right. Dark coloured squares are walls the agent can’t walk through while
    light coloured squares represent traversable ground. In each environment there
    are different elements to the world which affect how its final score is calculated.
    In all environments the objective is to complete the task as quickly as possible
    — each time step without meeting the goal means the agent loses points. Achieving
    the goal grants some amount of points provided the agent can do it quickly enough.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Such agents are typically trained through “Reinforcement Learning”. They take
    some actions (randomly at first) and are given a reward at the end of an “episode”.
    After each episode they can modify the algorithm they use to choose actions in
    the hopes that they will eventually learn to make the best decisions to achieve
    the highest reward. The modern approach is Deep Reinforcement Learning where the
    reward signal is used to optimise the weights of the model via gradient descent.
  prefs: []

    which contains something we want the agent to optimise or avoid. These hidden

    might expect that in order to minimise surprise the best course of action is just
    take familiar actions and stay in a familiar part of the environment. But one
    way to minimise surprise long-term is to engage in exploration in order to learn
    new things. This may increase surprise in the short term but gives an opportunity
    to be less surprised in the future. The FEP attempts to account for why intelligent
    organisms engage in learning, exploration, and creativity. It also explains how

    agent may try. Remember the Free Energy Principle (FEP). It’s likely that any
    capable agent we build will try to minimise how much its surprised about the world
    based on its model of the world (referred to as “minimsing free energy”). An important
    way to do that is to run experiments and try different things. Even if the core
    drive to minimise free energy remains, we don’t know what kinds of goals the agent
    may modify itself to achieve.

    is finished the state of the model is locked and it’s no longer capable of improving
    its capabilities based on new information. A limited approach exists with in-context
    few-shot learning and recursive summarisation using LLM agents. This is an interesting
    set of capabilities of LLMs but doesn’t truly represent “online learning”.

    into traffic is bad because (presumably) it learned to avoid that failure mode
    in its supervised training data. LLMs don’t need to learn that humans don’t respond
    to gibberish because producing human sounding language is part of the “next token

    being deployed. This learning would be based on their actions in the real world.
    Again, we can’t articulate to an AI agent all of the ways in which exploration
    could be unsafe. Is it possible to teach an agent to explore safely?

    better outcomes. Here the intermediate goals of an agent need not be orthogonal
    to our own. The better its world model the better it will be at navigating arbitray
    environments safely. A sufficiently capable agent could build simulations to explore
    potentially unsafe situations before it attempts to interact with them in the
    real world.

    seem unfair if you think well-designed agents should exclusively optimize the
    reward function that they are actually told to use. While this is the standard
    assumption, our choice here is deliberate and serves two purposes. First, the
    problems illustrate typical ways in which a misspecification manifests itself.
    For instance, reward gaming (Section 2.1.4) is a clear indicator for the presence
    of a loophole lurking inside the reward function. Second, we wish to highlight
    the problems that occur with the unrestricted maximization of reward. Precisely
    because of potential misspecification, we want agents not to follow the objective
    to the letter, but rather in spirit.'

    the reward more difficult. One important difference from specification problems
    is that any agent is incentivized to overcome robustness problems: if the agent
    could find a way to be more robust, it would likely gather more reward. As such,
    robustness can be seen as a subgoal or instrumental goal of intelligent agents
    (Omohundro, 2008; Bostrom, 2014, Ch. 7). In contrast, specification problems do
    not share this self-correcting property, as a faulty reward function does not
    incentivize the agent to correct it. This seems to suggest that addressing specification
    problems should be a higher priority for safety research.'

    only instances of more general problem classes. Agents that “overfit” to the environment
    suite, for example trained by peeking at the (ad hoc) performance function, would
    not constitute progress. Instead, we seek solutions that generalize. For example,
    solutions could involve general heuristics (e.g. biasing an agent towards reversible
    actions) or humans in the loop (e.g. asking for feedback, demonstrations, or advice).
    For the latter approach, it is important that no feedback is given on the agent’s

    to building capable agents. We can’t just train an agent aligned with *what we
    want it to do*. We can only train agents to optimise explicitly articulated objective
    functions. As agents become more capable of achieving arbitrary objectives they
    will engage in exploration, experimentation, and discovery which may be detrimental
    to humans as a whole. Additionally, as they become better at achieving an objective
    they will be able to learn how to maximise the reward from that objective regardless
    of what we intended. And sometimes they may encounter opportunities to deviate
    from their intended purpose for reasons that we won’t be able to anticipate.
