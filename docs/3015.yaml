- en: Most graphs are not worth looking at. No matter which industry you work in,
    or what your seniority level is — fact is that you likely come across plenty of
    mediocre data visualizations in your work.

- en: Good graphs bring home a specific message, and they do this fast. At the same
    time, they are visually appealing enough to invite the spectator to spend some
    more time on them and deepen their understanding of the key message. Good graphs
    also convey where they are from — which company or department — because they speak
    the same visual language.

- en: Bad graphs might contain plenty of information, but they fail to get the key
    message across to the spectator. Either they are trying to show too many things
    at once, or they are just so unappealing visually that the spectator looks elsewhere
    before having understood the message. The spectator has no idea who created a
    bad graph unless the creator tells them that it’s from them.

- en: Most data scientists, analysts, and similarly graph-creating professionals are
    smart enough to figure out how to create a good graph. The problem is that there
    is never enough time to do it.
