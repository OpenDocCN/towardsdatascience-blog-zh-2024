- en: If you have been reading my articles on Medium, you know I like to run experiments
    using AI for creative endeavors and write about my experiences. I have covered
    areas like image generation, creative writing, and music composition. For the
    first time, I expanded my research into the third dimension. I looked into using
    commercial and open-source AI tools to create new physical objects and printed
    them using a 3D printer. In this article, I will show you the steps I took to
    design and print four different 3D meshes using various commercial and open-source
    tools. You will find all four objects in the 3D Gallery in the appendix.

    different tools for 3D-object generation and show the results. The first was using
    commercial tools: [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/) for creating a 2D
    image and a website called [3dMaker.ai](https://3dmaker.ai/) for extracting a
    3D mesh, a file that contains the geometry for display and printing in 3D. The
    second experiment used an open-source AI model from OpenAI called Shape-E [1].
    The third used an…'
