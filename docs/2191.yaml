    we explored how many stars in our galaxy might have planets, and we used data
    to estimate the total number of stars with planets in the Milky Way. Now that
    we’ve tackled the stars, let’s take a closer look at the planets themselves. In
    **Part 2**, we’ll dive into how many of those planets could actually support life,
    how often life emerges, and how likely it is that life evolves into intelligent
    civilizations — like us.
