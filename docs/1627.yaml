- en: As I geared up for my Product Data Scientist interviews, I scoured the web for
    tips and frameworks on handling the “Success Metrics” interview question. Despite
    finding bits and pieces, a complete, end-to-end guide was missing. That’s why
    I’m excited to share the ultimate framework I crafted during my preparation, which
    landed me an offer from Meta! Dive in, and I hope it will work for you too!

    sure that you flesh out each and every word of the question and most importantly
    the product in scope. If you don’t ask any questions, that’s definitely a red
    flag, so please do!'

- en: Once the question is clear, then take a big breath and start your answer by
    **taking a big detour**. Yes, you read that right — don’t just jump into answering
    the question. It is paramount, and most importantly expected, to talk about the
    product, the mission of the company and how these two tie together before anything
    else. So please make sure that you talk about the points below.

    2 sides of users: the producers and the consumers. It is very important to talk
    about the user journey of both and even more important to give metrics later in
    your answer that cover both sides.'

    metrics is good to briefly talk about the benefits and costs of the product both

- en: '*One of the main benefits of FB Groups is that users with common interests
    can get together, which ties with Meta’s mission and contributes to FB app overall
    engagement. FB Groups also allow Meta to get a better understanding of the users’
    interests by looking at the groups they are members of, which in turn can help
    in making better recommendations and more engaging feed for the users.*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    FB’s Newsfeed, which is the “heart” of the FB app and the place where revenue
    is generated through ads. Another potential con is when groups do not get sufficient
    members or engagement, which could discourage the admins and create “empty shell”
    groups.*'

    about Meta’s NSM, which is the number of sessions per user per day. On top of
    that, Meta reports to Wall Street DAUs and MAUS. Hence when we talk about success
    metrics, and specifically when picking the primary metric, it’s important to keep
    the above in mind.*'

    from the two areas we mentioned above we’d focus on and it’s important to not
    over do it — 2 or 3 to-the-point metrics per area are more than enough. Please
    note how we make sure to have metrics that cover both the producer and consumer
    sides of users.'

    offer from Meta! The same framework can be used for any Product/Success Metrics
    questions asked for Data Science positions. Having a well-structured response
    that thoroughly scopes out all the important components and takes the interviewer
    along your thought process is key. Hope you enjoyed it and would love to hear
    your feedback in the comments below!
