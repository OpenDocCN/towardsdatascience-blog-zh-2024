    typing in a request ***(prompt)*** in their natural language. Through this conversational

    OpenAI released an alpha version of a ChatGPT plugin called [***Code Interpreter***](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/code-interpreter)***.***
    With it, anyone could load a dataset into ChatGPT, type a few prompts and invoke
    Python to perform regression analysis, descriptive analysis and even create visualizations.
    All without having to write any code!

    (SQL, R, and Python, to name a few) along with the nascent capabilities of Code
    Interpreter, many began to predict the eventual demise of the data analyst role.
    (**At the time, I begged to differ and even wrote an article about it)*.***

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first attempt at implementing conversational data analytics predated the
    ChatGPT release. In 2019, Microsoft‚Äôs ubiquitous ***Power BI*** released a feature
    called ‚ÄúQ&A.‚Äù It allowed users to type questions about their data in their natural
    language, as long as it is English (currently the only supported language).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is done through a text box interface embedded within an existing dashboard
    or report. Through this interface, users ask questions about the dataset behind
    that particular dashboard or report in natural language. Power BI utilizes ***Natural
    Language Query(NLQ),*** to translate text questions into a query. The responses
    are rendered in visualizations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While this feature has its uses, it has one significant limitation. Power BI
    Q&A is limited to only querying the dataset behind the report or dashboard being
    looked at, which is much too narrow of scope if your ultimate goal is the company-wide
    democratization of data.

    potentially support data democracy is [***Snowflake‚Äôs Cortex Analyst***](https://www.snowflake.com/en/blog/cortex-analyst-ai-self-service-analytics/).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To briefly summarize, Snowflake itself is an ever-growing SaaS, cloud-based
    data warehousing and analytics platform that offers clients the option to scale
    their storage and/or compute up or down as they need. Its architecture also supports
    high-speed data processing and querying.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cortex Analyst is Snowflake‚Äôs version of conversational AI-driven data analytics.
    Right off the bat, it has one huge advantage over Power BI‚Äôs Q&A, in that instead
    of only allowing users to query against a dataset behind an existing report or
    dashboard, Cortex Analyst will let the user query against the entire underlying
    database. It does this by ***relying on the semantic layer and model to interpret
    user requests***.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Having a **fully vetted semantic layer in place** is an absolute **prerequisite
    to data democracy**. It only makes sense that before you empower everyone within
    your company with the ability to work with data, there must be a universally agreed-upon
    definition of the data and metrics being used. More on this later.

    to data democracy are not technological.***
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    include a strong data infrastructure that fully addresses the previously mentioned
    ***semantic layer and model***, ***data literacy, data quality and data governance.***
    In and of themselves, **each** of these is a significant project and the reality
    is that, for many companies, these are still works in progress.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To wit, while 92% of business decision-makers believe that data literacy is
    important, only 34% of companies currently offer data literacy training (source
    [**Data Literacy Index, Wharton School of Business**](https://thedataliteracyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Qlik-The_Data_Literacy_Index_October-2018.pdf)).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another challenge is one that I have seen over the entirety of my career in
    data analysis. In my experience, there has always been a cadre of users (some
    of them at the C-level) who, for various reasons, refused to utilize the BI interfaces
    we created for them. While they were typically a minority of people, it did remind
    us that while bells and whistles are great, many will stubbornly continue to only
    work with what they are most familiar with.

    they are the best equipped to leverage conversational analytics to get their answers
