    the Bar for AI Product Managers](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/we-need-to-raise-the-bar-for-ai-product-managers-ae0f3f933910),”
    highlighted a shared passion for advancing the field of AI product management.
    Many current and aspiring PMs have since reached out, asking how they can learn
    more about AI on their path to becoming an AI product manager.
  prefs: []

- en: 'In my experience, the most effective AI PMs excel in two key areas: identifying
    opportunities where AI can add value, and working with model developers to deploy
    the technology effectively. This requires a solid understanding of how different
    kinds of models are likely to behave when they go live in a real product— a reality
    that often surprises newcomers. The gap between flashy demos or early-stage prototypes
    and actual product performance can be substantial, whether you’re dealing with
    customer-facing applications or backend data pipelines that power products.'

- en: The best way to develop this intuition is by deploying a range of models into
    products and making plenty of mistakes along the way. The next best thing is to
    explore what other teams at your company are doing and learn from their mistakes
    (and triumphs). Dig up any documentation you can find and, where possible, listen
    in on product reviews or team updates. Often, people who worked directly on the
    projects will be happy to chat, answer your questions, and provide more context,
    especially if your team might be considering anything similar.

    company is focused on a very narrow set of technologies? Or maybe you’re in the
    midst of a job search?

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to checking out resources to familiarize yourself with terminology
    and best practices, I recommend developing your own AI projects . I also recommend
    doing side projects even if you can learn a lot from your day job. Every AI use
    case has its own nuances, and the more examples you can get close to, the faster
    you’ll develop an intuition about what does and doesn’t work.

- en: For a starter project, I recommend starting with LLMs like [Claude](https://claude.ai/)
    or [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/). You should be able to get something substantial
    up and running in a matter of hours (minutes if you already know how to code and
    write effective prompts). While not all AI projects at a real company will use
    LLMs, they are gaining significant traction. More importantly, it’s much easier
    to create your own working model with only rudimentary data science or coding
    knowledge. If your coding skills are rusty, using the developer APIs will give
    you a chance to brush up, and if you get stuck the LLM is a great resource to
    help with both code generation and troubleshooting. If you’re new to both coding
    and LLMs, then using the online chat interface is a great way to warm up.
