    and that most people believe is always better when it is higher.

- en: With the rise in attention on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the increasing
    awareness of lapses in reliability or accuracy of outputs, it is important for
    more people to understand that data products, such as AI, don’t follow the same
    rules of consistency or accuracy of other technologies.

- en: To illustrate, let me introduce the concept of a “Confusion Matrix”. This will
    be very familiar to any Data Scientists that have built predictive models for
    classification purposes. It may be new to others but I find that the concept,
    the methodology and the human/business interaction involved are a useful case
    study to understand accuracy terminology in machine learning more broadly. It
    is a helpful visual tool to understand both nuance and trade-offs in these terms.

    (the sum of the green boxes above) out of all total predictions (the sum of the
    four boxes above). So this is where you may here terms like “Our pregnancy test
    is 99%…
