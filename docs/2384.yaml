    role is to help large companies adopt AI technologies to boost their performance
    and innovate. In the past three years, I have been collaborating with different
    AI teams and decision makers across North America to build and test custom AI
    models for specific business needs.

    back at me intrigued. They do not fully get the question. For some others, they
    mention a strategic objective identified by the board or a C-level executive.
    But more often than not, Generative AI is not the best answer to address their
    business priorities.

    the world started to play with this intriguing new tool. My neighbor, the guy
    at the grocery store, my uncle and my little niece. AI users were everywhere and
    on every lips.
