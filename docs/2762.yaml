- en: Data analysis is primarily used to identify and quantify correlations and patterns
    between variables so that they can be used for future predictions and corresponding
    models can be trained. The correlation matrix is a crucial method that helps to
    graphically represent the correlation, i.e. the dependency, between two variables
    in a dataset.

- en: In this article, we take an in-depth look at the concept of correlation and
    how the correlation matrix helps to show the dependencies between variables. This
    includes, for example, looking at the calculation and interpretation of the correlation
    matrix in detail and explaining how such a matrix can be created in Python. A
    comprehensive picture also includes showing the limitations of this method so
    that its use and significance can be correctly assessed.

    the relationships between different variables in a dataset. The pairwise correlations
    between all combinations of two variables are shown in a tabular structure. Each
