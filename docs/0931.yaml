    about. Most people will already have this somewhat figured out, but simply saying,
    “I want to learn data science,” is probably insufficient as it’s quite vague.
    Data science encapsulates many areas, such as maths, statistics, and coding, to
    state the obvious ones, but these can be broken down even further.
