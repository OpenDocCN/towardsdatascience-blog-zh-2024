    is called `alpha`, but in mathematical notation it’s typically written as *λ*

    as *α* (alpha) in mathematical notation. We use the mathematical symbols here
    to match standard textbook notation.'

    0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100) and `l1_ratio` values (like 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75,

    its parameters, it’s better to use the specific command made for each type of
    regression. In scikit-learn, use `LinearRegression` for OLS, `Ridge` for Ridge
    regression, and `Lasso` for Lasso regression. Only use Elastic Net when you want
    to combine both Lasso and Ridge''s special features together.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Start with **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** when you have more samples than
    features in your dataset, and when your features don’t strongly predict each other.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Ridge Regression** works well when you have the opposite situation — lots
    of features compared to your number of samples. It’s also great when your features
    are strongly connected to each other.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Lasso Regression** is best when you want to discover which features actually
    matter for your predictions. It will automatically set unimportant features to
    zero, making your model simpler.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Elastic Net** combines the strengths of both Ridge and Lasso. It’s useful
    when you have groups of related features and want to either keep or remove them
    together. If you’ve tried Ridge and Lasso separately and weren’t happy with the
    results, Elastic Net might give you better predictions.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A good strategy is to start with Ridge if you want to keep all your features.
    You can move on to Lasso if you want to identify the important ones. If neither
    gives you good results, then move on to Elastic Net.
