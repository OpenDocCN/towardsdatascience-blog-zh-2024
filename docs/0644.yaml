- en: In this story, I would like to raise a discussion about unit testing in data
    engineering. Although there are plenty of articles on Python unit testing on the
    internet, the topic looks a bit vague and uncovered. We will speak about data
    pipelines, the parts they consist of and how we can test them to ensure continuous
    delivery. Each step of the data pipeline can be considered as a function or process
    and ideally, it should be tested not only as a unit but all together, integrated
    into one single data flow process. Iâ€™ll try to summarize the techniques that I
    use often to mock, patch and test data pipelines including integration and automated
    tests.

    make sure the code is reliable and can be easily maintained in the future. Consider
    our data pipeline as a set of processing steps or functions. In this case, unit
    testing can be considered as a technique of writing tests to ensure that each
    unit of our code, or each step of our data pipeline doesnâ€™t produce unintended
    results and is fit for purpose.
