    to a more exciting data or ML role followed a fairly well-defined sequence. You
    learned new skills and expanded your existing ones, demonstrated your experience,
    zoomed in on the most fitting listings, and… sooner or later, something good would
    come your way.

    But even so, we’ve experienced somewhat of a mood shift in the past few months:
    the job market is more competitive, companies’ hiring processes more demanding,
    and there appears to be a lot more uncertainty and fluidity in tech and beyond.'
