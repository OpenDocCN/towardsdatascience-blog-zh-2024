    at a retail company. It has multiple stores, several departments, and countless
    products being sold every day. As your first task, your manager asks you: What
    are the factors that influence a customerâ€™s purchase decisions?'

    a purchase or not. In fact, that would be much easier. Building a model like that
    is straightforward. What the manager wants is this: **What factors influence a
    customerâ€™s buying decision?** â€” Now that makes things a bit more complex.'

    is what we usually do with Linear Regression in Machine Learning. Itâ€™s about identifying
    various scenarios to **pinpoint what factors drive a purchase decision**. This
    is where youâ€™ll need a different technique, and thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m going to bring
    in this project through factor analysis, a dimensionality reduction strategy.
