- en: Developing a clean and appealing website for your ML application can be difficult,
    especially if your primary work consists of backend or machine learning tasks.
    Personally, I mostly work on developing ML models and automation tasks, meaning
    I don't spend a lot of time writing frontend code or working with design. I often
    use [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to deploy my machine learning models quickly,
    and I still think Streamlit has its place for quickly making machine learning
    models available. However, Streamlit should only be used for initial testing;
    if you want to attract consumers to your website, you have to develop a better-looking
    page to intrigue and retain the consumers going to your page.

- en: In this article, I will describe how I used [v0 by Vercel](https://v0.dev/)
    to quickly develop a nice-looking website for my RAG search application for Norwegian
    court rulings. I have previously written a separate [article about developing
    the RAG search](/implementing-anthropics-contextual-retrieval-for-powerful-rag-performance-b85173a65b83).
    The best part is that it is completely free to use, and as long as you stay within
    the quota of prompts, you are provided with them without cost.
