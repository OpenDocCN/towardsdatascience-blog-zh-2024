- en: The constant flow of model releases, new tools, and cutting-edge research can
    make it difficult to pause for a few minutes and reflect on AI’s big picture.
    What are the questions that practitioners are trying to answer—or, at least, need
    to be aware of? What does all the innovation actually mean for the people who
    work in data science and machine learning, and for the communities and societies
    that these evolving technologies stand to shape for years to come?

- en: Our lineup of standout articles this week tackle these questions from multiple
    angles—from the business models supporting (and sometimes generating) the buzz
    behind AI to the core goals that models can and cannot achieve. Ready for some
    thought-provoking discussions? Let’s dive in.

    the promise of this technology and the practical reality?” [Stephanie Kirmer](https://medium.com/u/a8dc77209ef3?source=post_page---user_mention--5e7c1da38b41--------------------------------)’s
    latest article takes a direct, uncompromising look at the business case for AI
    products—a timely exploration, given the increasing pessimism (in some circles,
    at least) about the industry’s near-future prospects.

    grapple with the process of actually building them. [Almog Baku](https://medium.com/u/fbcd18957436?source=post_page---user_mention--5e7c1da38b41--------------------------------)’s
    recent articles aim to add structure and clarity into an ecosystem that can often
    feel chaotic; taking a cue from software developers, his latest contribution focuses
    on the core product-design principles practitioners should adhere to when building
    AI apps.

    latest article zooms in on the inner workings of the transformer architecture
    to open up a very different line of inquiry: the insights we might gain about
    human cognition and the human brain by better understanding the complex mathematical
    operations within AI systems.'

    not just what it can accomplish, but also what it cannot. [Quentin Gallea, PhD](https://medium.com/u/a52dcb9793ad?source=post_page---user_mention--5e7c1da38b41--------------------------------)
    highlights the importance of this distinction in his primer on predictive and
    causal inference, where he unpacks the reasons why models have become so good
    at the former while they still struggle with the latter.
