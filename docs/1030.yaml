    [“Titanic” challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic). We will explain
    how to approach and solve such a challenge, and demonstrate this with a top 7%
    solution for “Titanic”.

    learning competitions, see the intro for examples. It is a great way to test and
    improve your data science / ML knowledge and learn how to solve problems hands-on.
    Plus, you can even win monetary prices! However, Kaggle is populated by some of
    the best data scientists and ML people out there — and prices are only given to
    the few top solutions (out of several hundreds or thousands) — thus winning here
