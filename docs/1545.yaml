- en: Have you ever wondered how a computer actually *remembers* things? Sure, you’ve
    heard that it uses RAM as “short-term” memory and your HDD or SSD is “long-term”
    memory. But, how do devices such as these actually hold onto information? That’s
    the question we are going to answer in this article.

- en: As data scientists, we typically use high-level tools. Python is great, but
    it hides from you a lot of the nuts and bolts that make a computer work for the
    sake of simplicity. And yet, computers are the tools of our trade — doesn’t it
    make sense that we should understand how they work? This article is the third
    in my series “A Budding Data Scientist’s Introduction to Computer Hardware”. Don’t
    worry if you missed the first two— you don’t really need them to follow along,
    but they will help you get to a deeper level of understanding (if you want to
    read the others, you can find links to the others at the bottom of this article).

- en: The point of this series is to give new (or experienced) data scientists a glimpse
    at how the tools they use daily actually work, without assuming any knowledge
    about physics, electrical engineering, or low-level computer science concepts.
    If you are curious about how computers…
