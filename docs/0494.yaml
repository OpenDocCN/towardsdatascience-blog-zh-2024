- en: A search engine is an interface of a source index sorted by reputation. A chatbot
    is an interface of a language model extrapolating from the sources. Google was
    built on the crucial idea of reputation-based search and the crucial ideas that
    enabled language models emerged from Google. The machine learning methods used
    to train chatbots were a relatively marginal AI topic until a Google boost around
    2010\. The 2010 edition of Russel-Norvig’s 1100-page monograph on “Artificial
    Intelligence — A Modern Approach” devoted 10 pages to neural networks. The 2020
    edition tripled the length of the neural networks section and doubled the machine
    learning chapter.

    an AI”. But the honest truth is that they are not children of AI expert systems

    or counting words in a sentence. Or elaphants in the room. They are not as smart
    as a pocket calculator or a 4-year-old child.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But most adults are also unable to multiply 372 with 273 in their head. We use
    fingers to count and a pencil and paper, or a pocket calculator, to multiply.
    We use them because our natural language capabilities include only rudimentary
    arithmetic operations, which we perform in our heads. Chatbots simulate our languages
    and inherit our shortcomings. They don’t have builtin pocket calculators. They
    need fingers for counting. Equipped with external memory, a chatbot can count
    and calculate, like most humans. Without external memory, both chatbots and humans
    are limited by the capacity of their internal memory, the attention.

    sleep, we did not equip them with “reality-checking” mechanisms. That would require
    going beyond pre-training, to ongoing consistency testing.

- en: When people talk about a chair, they assume that they are talking about the
    same thing because they have seen a chair. A chatbot has never seen a chair, or
    anything else. It has only ever seen words and the binaries scraped from the web.
    If it is fed an image of a chair, it is still just another binary, just like the
    word “chair”.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When a chatbot says “chair”, it does not refer to an object in the world. There
    is no world, just binaries. They refer to each other. They form meaningful combinations,
    found to be likely in the training set. Since the chatbot’s training set originates
    from people who have seen chairs, the chatbot’s statements about chairs make similar
    references. Chatbot remixes meaningful statements, and the mixes appear meaningful.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The fact that meaning, thought to be a relation between the words and the world,
    can be maintained so compellingly as a relation between words and words, and nothing
    but words, — that is a BIG elephant in the room.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    undeniably a delusion, then what reason do we have to believe that anyone means
    what they say? That is an elephant of a question.

- en: Chatbots are trained on data scraped from the Web. A lot of it is protected
    by copyright. Copyright owners protest the unauthorized use of their data. Chatbot
    designers and operators try to filter out the copyrighted data, or to compensate
    the rightful owners. The latter may be a profit-sharing opportunity, but the former
    is likely to turn out to be a flying pink elephant.
  prefs: []

- en: The problems of copyright protections of electronic content are older than the
    chatbots and the Web. The original idea of copyright was that the owner of a printing
    press purchases from writers the right to copy and sell their writings, from musicians
    their music, and so on. The business of publishing is based on that idea.

- en: '**Goods can be privately owned only if they can be secured.** If a lion cannot
    prevent the antelope from drinking water on the other side of a water well, then
    he cannot claim that he owns the water well. The market of digital content depends
    on the availability of methods to secure digital transmissions. The market for
    books was solid as long as the books were solid and could be physically secured.
    With the advent of electronic content creation and distribution, the copyright
    controls became harder. The easier it is to copy the copyrighted content, the
    harder it is to secure it and to protect the copyright.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The idea of the World Wide Web, as a global public utility for disseminating
    digital content, was a blow to the idea of private ownership of digital creations.
    Stakeholders’ efforts to defend the market of digital content have led to *Digital
    Rights Management (DRM)* technologies. The idea was to protect digital content
    using cryptography. But to play a DVD, the consumer device must decrypt it. On
    the way from the disc to the viewer’s eyes, the content can be diverted into a
    recorder and pirated. Goodbye, DRM security. It was mostly realized through obscurity.
    The history of the DRM copy protections was an arms race between content distributors’
    obfuscations and ripper distributors’ updates; and a boat race from publishers’
    law offices to pirates’ safe havens. The publishers were happy to retreat from
    DVDs to streaming, where the economy of marginal costs and the distribution technology
    turned the races in their favor. But the can has just been kicked down the road.
    For the most part, the search and social media providers have been playing the
    role of fearless seafarers who started as pirates and built colonial empires,
    controlling the creators through terms of service and the publishers through profit-sharing
    contracts. In which direction will the chatbot providers evolve this business
    model remains to be seen.

    to be on track to exterminating themselves in the future by making the environment
    uninhabitable for their children in exchange for making themselves wealthier today.
    Even some people view that as irrational. You don’t need a chatbot to see that
    elephant. But greed is like smoking. Stressful but addictive.

    then a corporation is intelligent. Many corporations are too complex to be controlled
    by a single human manager. They are steered by computational networks where the
    human nodes play their roles. But we all know firsthand that human nodes don’t
    even control their own network behaviors, let alone the network itself. Yet a
    corporate management network does solve problems and intelligently optimizes its
    object functions. It is an artificially intelligent entity.
