- en: However, if you are ready to get to the next level of building software with
    Python, your code should not just run and pass some tests. It should also be written
    with the available computing resources — and the energy bill — in mind.

- en: Every inefficient loop, poorly chosen data structure, or redundant computation
    burns more electricity than necessary. Unlike C, for example, where you must reserve
    bits from your disk for each new variable you create, Python will consume resources
    as it sees fit. This makes it extremely beginner-friendly, but also rather energy-intensive
    when used wrong.

- en: Sloppy algorithms are not just bad for the performance of a code. They are bad
    for the planet, too. Software companies like [Microsoft are struggling](https://www.geekwire.com/2024/microsofts-carbon-footprint-keeps-growing-as-ai-drives-data-center-expansions/)
    to keep their carbon emissions low because of all of the energy they consume for
    AI and other tasks. At the same time, sustainability is a growing concern. Sustainability-minded
    programmers are therefore becoming a valuable resource for many companies.
