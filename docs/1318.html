ot fj bk">Biological organisms transduce information from the environment, process it (what cognitive science studies), and output behaviour conducive to survival. Such behaviours, at the most basic level, involve foraging for food, reproducing, and avoiding harm. They also involves the wide spectrum of human activity such as play, creativity, problem-solving, design and engineering, socializing, romance, and intellectual life.</p><p id="800c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ob oc fq od b go ou of og gr ov oi oj no ow ol om ns ox oo op nw oy or os ot fj bk">Now, how do we engineer a system that is able to do all of the above?</p><p id="55bc" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ob oc fq od b go ou of og gr ov oi oj no ow ol om ns ox oo op nw oy or os ot fj bk">If we were to model a simple organism as a function of some environment, we would need a model of the agent, the environment, and some function that moves that agent from some present state to some desired state.</p><p id="6699" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ob oc fq od b go ou of og gr ov oi oj no ow ol om ns ox oo op nw oy or os ot fj bk">In psychology, two major schools of thought purport to explain human behaviour: <em class="oz">behaviourism </em>and <em class="oz">cognitive science</em>. Behaviourists understand behaviour as a function of learning mechanisms, where learning can be attributed to output behaviour. Cognitive science, on the other hand, models agent interaction with the environment through the information-processing approach. In this approach, the agent transduces external stimuli into an internal representation initially by the senses and subsequently subjects it to layers of transformation and integration all the way up to thinking and reasoning faculties, before returning some behaviourial output. In the former approach, learning is understood largely as a function of environmental conditioning, whereas in the latter, mental representations are considered indispensable in predicting behaviour. Reinforcement learning borrows mostly from the behaviorist approach where environmental reward dictates the evolution of the agent within search space.</p><p id="b6b8" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ob oc fq od b go ou of og gr ov oi oj no ow ol om ns ox oo op nw oy or os ot fj bk"><a class="af nc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Operant conditioning</a>, the school of behaviorist psychology that reigned in the 1950s-60s, defined learning as the product of the environmental mechanisms of reward and punishment. Precursors to operant conditioning included the <a class="af nc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_effect" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Law of Effect</a> proposed by Edward Thorndike which proposed that behaviors that produce satisfying effects are more likely to recur, whereas behaviors that produce dissatisfying effects less likely. B.F. Skinner operationalized effects in terms of reinforcement and punishment. Reinforcement increases the likelihood of the recurrence of a behavior, whether it be approach or removal of the inhibitory factor. Approach is termed positive reinforcement, and the reversal of avoidance, negative reinforcement. An example of positive reinforcement includes becoming good at a sport and winning often. An example of negative reinforcement includes removing the inhibitory stimulus, e.g. the school bully who taunts you during games. Operant conditioning predicts that you’re likely to repeat behaviours that receive the greatest reward. Punishment, on the other hand, consists of controlling the behavioural effect by either adding a negative consequence (positive punishment) or removing the reward associated with the behaviour (negative punishment). When fouling causes expulsion from the game, it illustrates positive punishment. When you perform poorly and lose games it illustrates negative punishment, which may cause avoidance of playing in the future.</p><p id="4012" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ob oc fq od b go ou of og gr ov oi oj no ow ol om ns ox oo op nw oy or os ot fj bk">Much of the game of life in human society is replete with <em class="oz">secondary reinforcers</em> or socially constructed rewards and punishments that condition behaviour. These include money, grades, university admittance criteria, rules for winning and losing games, which build upon natural reinforcers that are closer to biological needs like food, reproduction, and social approbation.</p><p id="2133" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ob oc fq od b go ou of og gr ov oi oj no ow ol om ns ox oo op nw oy or os ot fj bk">Memory plays an important role in learning because it enables the retention of prior experiences. Evidence shows that memory encodes the rewards and punishments more so than the content of the experience (Tyng et al., 2017). Subjects are likely to remember rewarding experiences fondly and thereby likely to repeat them, and negative experiences unfavourably, and likely to avoid them in the future. The mechanisms of memory are complicated and diverse, and evidence suggests that subjects play an active role in reshaping their memories by recalling them (Spens &amp; Burgess, 2024). This fact complicates the picture for behaviorism because the subject’s interpretation of an experience can be retrospectively modified and reframed, making prediction on conditioning principles alone difficult. Furthermore, rewards and punishments oversimplify the landscape of positive and negative affects, which comprises a complex terrain of valleys and troughs, nested dependencies, and is better modeled as a continuous spectrum rather than a binary space.</p><p id="5562" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ob oc fq od b go ou of og gr ov oi oj no ow ol om ns ox oo op nw oy or os ot fj bk">These complexities notwithstanding, reinforcement learning comprises an array of mathematical techniques that adapt the behavioural ontology of agent, environment, and rewards in order to model artificial intelligence. As we will see below, aspects of reinforcement learning emerge from control theory, whose precursors extend into physics and engineering, and other aspects emerge more directly from psychology and biology. Since both the objects of control theory and living systems comprise dynamical systems that must stay within an optimal range of far-from thermodynamic equilibrium, the underlying principles are amenable to the goals of reinforcement learning and artificial intelligence more broadly.</p><p id="c7e2" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ob oc fq od b go ou of og gr ov oi oj no ow ol om ns ox oo op nw oy or os ot fj bk">Dynamic programming emerged chiefly from control theory as a mathematical optimization method that enables larger problems to be broken down recursively into sub-problems as a means of solving the larger problem. Generally speaking, recursion refers to a function that passes itself directly or indirectly as a parameter.</p><p id="68a4" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ob oc fq od b go ou of og gr ov oi oj no ow ol om ns ox oo op nw oy or os ot fj bk">In this article, we will focus chiefly on the elements of dynamic programming, with a focus on discrete and finite games. However, dynamic programming exhibits a variety of limitations that are in part addressed by model-free approaches to reinforcement learning and others by combining dynamic programming with artificial neural networks, once called <em class="oz">neurodynamic programming</em>. More broadly, the marriage of reinforcement learning and artificial neural networks is termed deep reinforcement learning. These models incorporate the strengths of deep learning within reinforcement learning techniques. The most popular of these algorithms include the <strong class="od fr">Deep Q-Networks (DQN)</strong>, which were introduced by <a class="af nc" href="https://deepmind.google/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">DeepMind</a> in 2013. This family of algorithms leverages deep learning to approximate the Q-function. Since function-approximation is one of the shortcomings of reinforcement learning, these algorithms represent a major improvement of the reinforcement paradigm.</p><p id="20fe" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ob oc fq od b go ou of og gr ov oi oj no ow ol om ns ox oo op nw oy or os ot fj bk">Other shortcomings addressed by <strong class="od fr">DQN </strong>include conferring flexibility in capturing nonlinear dynamics, admitting a much wider range of dimensions without becoming computationally intractable from the <em class="oz">curse of dimensionality</em>, and greater generalization capacity over the environment.</p><p id="bcd1" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ob oc fq od b go ou of og gr ov oi oj no ow ol om ns ox oo op nw oy or os ot fj bk">Neurodynamic programming represents a step in the direction of leveraging the cognitive paradigm in psychology to address the shortcomings of the purely behaviourist approach. It is worth noting, however, that while scientific progress has been made in understanding the hierarchical organization and processing of lower-level perceptual information, the scaffolding of that information to thought and consciousness remains, more or less, scientifically elusive. For this reason, artificial neural networks (ANNs) as yet lack the complex generalization capacity of human intelligence which tends to learn with exponentially smaller samples than ANNs. We will discuss the implications of adopting the principles of reinforcement learning toward artificial general intelligence (AGI) in the last section of the article.</p><h2 id="cce5" class="nd ne fq bf nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa bk">Decision Theory &amp; Control Theory</h2><p id="57ac" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ob oc fq od b go oe of og gr oh oi oj no ok ol om ns on oo op nw oq or os ot fj bk">Before delving into the mathematical elements of dynamic programming and reinforcement learning, it is important to flesh out the relationship between the philosophical and mathematical branch of decision theory and reinforcement learning. While decision theory consists primarily of mathematical formalizations of rational choice theory, they overlap with the goals of reinforcement learning insofar as reinforcement learning seeks to scaffold its models into successful artificial agents that can interact with complex environments and information landscapes.</p><p id="bcff" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ob oc fq od b go ou of og gr ov oi oj no ow ol om ns ox oo op nw oy or os ot fj bk"><strong class="od fr">Decision theory</strong>, also known as <strong class="od fr">choice theory</strong>, was developed in the 20th century at the heel of the growing formalization of <a class="af nc" href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationality-instrumental/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">instrumental reason</a>. Specifically, it uses probability theory to quantify the probability of agent actions given their preferences. A crowning achievement of this formalization effort was the <a class="af nc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenstern_utility_theorem" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><strong class="od fr"><em class="oz">Von-Neumann-Morgenstern utility</em></strong></a><strong class="od fr"><em class="oz"> </em></strong>procedure.

The essential mechanism consists of a controller that measures the desired variable and compares it to a set point, whose difference is fed as feedback for correction. The broad strokes of control theory mirror metabolic processes of living organisms, who maintain a set point of internal temperature against variable external conditions. The connection of control theory to decision theory is obvious: both rely on feedback from the environment to maintain or advance the state of the system toward some form of optimality.</p><p id="e44e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ob oc fq od b go ou of og gr ov oi oj no ow ol om ns ox oo op nw oy or os ot fj bk">Mathematically, subsets of both control and decision problems can be reduced to optimization problems solvable through dynamic programming.

As we demonstrate the rudiments of reinforcement learning, we will delve into the heart of dynamic programming: the recursive relationship between the state and value functions of the agent.</p><p id="d45c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ob oc fq od b go ou of og gr ov oi oj no ow ol om ns ox oo op nw oy or os ot fj bk">Reinforcement learning and decision theory overlap in defining a procedure for maximizing reward or utility. However, whereas utility is explicitly defined in decision theory, which aims to model economic behaviour, in reinforcement learning utility is substituted by cumulative reward. Different policies relative to different task goals can be applied toward maximizing cumulative reward, which, as we will see, depends on the inverse relationship between the polar directions of exploration and exploitation termed the <em class="oz">exploration-exploitation dilemma</em>.</p><p id="8783" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ob oc fq od b go ou of og gr ov oi oj no ow ol om ns ox oo op nw oy or os ot fj bk">Let’s begin by outlining the ontology underlying reinforcement models.</p><h2 id="2c14" class="nd ne fq bf nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa bk">States, Actions &amp; Rewards</h2><p id="8646" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ob oc fq od b go oe of og gr oh oi oj no ok ol om ns on oo op nw oq or os ot fj bk">Reinforcement learning leverages the theoretical apparatus of decision theory to construct models comprising agents, environments, and a dynamic evolution rule.

The game of chess, for example, can be formalized as an episodic task because it has a a finite configuration space and a predefined end-state of three possible outcomes: win, lose, draw.

Since averages over sufficient samples converge to expectations, model-free approaches estimate expectations through sample means. Monte Carlo methods compute value functions by estimating the expected cumulative returns of a sufficiently large sample of state-action pairs. Some Monte-Carlo methods evaluate the value function only at the end of the task for episodic tasks.

Initially, every connected destination would have an equal distribution of probabilities. For example, if upon leaving home you have the option to drive or take the metro, we’d ascribe initial probabilities to each of these possible future states as 0.5.

These are recursively related.</p><p id="5653" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ob oc fq od b go ou of og gr ov oi oj no ow ol om ns ox oo op nw oy or os ot fj bk">Let’s expound on these ideas with a relatable example. Let’s say that you are at a suboptimal state in your life and want to change this. Let’s further say that you have a tangible goal or place you would like to be in the future within some realistic time horizon. In order to arrive at the grand goal (here you can substitute anything: better job, start a family etc), you will need to take a series of smaller steps or actions that will be conducive to your desired outcome. Translated in the language of reinforcement learning, your current state will be assigned a value. Given your current state and value, you will take actions. These actions will also be evaluated with respect to your overall goal and current state. A good action will receive a higher valuation than a bad action. Feedback from the environment will determine the value of the action (how these are determined varies with the task). The evaluation of the state will affect the valuation of the available actions and successor states. And the evaluation of the actions will recursively affect the value of the current state. In other words, actions and states are dynamically connected through recursion.</p><p id="1685" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ob oc fq od b go ou of og gr ov oi oj no ow ol om ns ox oo op nw oy or os ot fj bk">Now, in real life, your goal and the action-steps to get to that goal cannot be specified as a deterministic system with discrete time-steps and and a discrete state-space (though perhaps they could be approximated this way). Instead, dynamic programming assumes a specifiable environment much like the game of chess, where time-steps and action-spaces are abstracted as discrete and finite.

This means that it doesn’t use the policy 𝛑 to learn Q(s’,a’). SARSA, on the other hand, is an on-policy method that selects an action from the previous action taken and an estimate of the next state-action pair, Q(s’,a’).

Theta 𝜃 parameters are equivalent to weights <em class="oz">w</em> in neural networks, which are associated with connections between neurons. The weights determine the strength of the connections and are retroactively adjusted through backpropagation in order to minimize the error. DQN takes as input a high-dimensional representation of the environment and outputs a vector of action-values for each possible action. The expected return is typically approximated through an MC or TD approach. Backpropagation with an optimization function are then used to compute policy gradient and reduce the error by adjusting the policy network parameters 𝜃.</p><p id="f5bb" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ob oc fq od b go ou of og gr ov oi oj no ow ol om ns ox oo op nw oy or os ot fj bk">Because ANNs are highly sensitive to new information, it can cause catastrophic forgetting, where new information can overwrite previously written information.

Intelligence, even in the human context, cannot be extricated from the contours of organismic viability. This isn’t, however, the orthodoxy. The general wisdom argues that intelligence is more akin to a program or software that computes inferences on the basis of available information.</p><p id="51ce" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ob oc fq od b go ou of og gr ov oi oj no ow ol om ns ox oo op nw oy or os ot fj bk">The latter conception consists of two models, which are mistakenly thought of as competing. One model describes intelligence as following procedures, whereas the other describes intelligence as generalizing from data for optimal prediction. The former is generally much better understood, whereas the latter amounts to a cluster of techniques that reliably improve the strength of predictions. Animal intelligence is largely based on the latter model.</p><p id="6b30" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ob oc fq od b go ou of og gr ov oi oj no ow ol om ns ox oo op nw oy or os ot fj bk">The most successful paradigm of the second model is deep learning through artificial neural networks. The chief advantage of ANN architectures is that they enable generalization from data without prior information or concepts, although this is not to be confused with unsupervised learning. ANNs first build a model through training and then make predictions on the basis of that model on new data. It is thought, therefore, that the brain does something similar (after factoring pre-training from evolution). However, there are currently two weaknesses within ANNs. The first weakness is that the goal or outcome has to be set by the human designer. An ANN cannot of its own accord conceive of goals. It cannot, a fortiriori, tell the difference between truth and falsity of its own accord. The human designer must supply the true outcome in order for the model to learn to approximate that outcome. The second weakness is that an ANN, without reinforcement learning, cannot search an environment to optimize its own state. For this reason, the combination of the generalization and predictive power of ANNs with the decision optimization power of reinforcement learning makes for a formidable amalgamation.</p><p id="7b14" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ob oc fq od b go ou of og gr ov oi oj no ow ol om ns ox oo op nw oy or os ot fj bk">It is on this basis that some have argued that reinforcement learning represents the clearest path toward artificial general intelligence (Sutton, 2014). The intuition behind this is clear: reinforcement learning comes closest to modelling living systems, which when enhanced with other successful architectures like transformers may lead to a model of AI that replicates (and exceeds!) all human capabilities.</p><p id="3297" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ob oc fq od b go ou of og gr ov oi oj no ow ol om ns ox oo op nw oy or os ot fj bk">However, if humans are the basis of general intelligence, then the conception of general intelligence cannot be one that divorces intelligence from survival constraints and some form of embodiment. On the other hand, if general intelligence can be defined without reference to living organisms, then it isn’t clear what it would look like — purely abstract models escape satisfactory formalization despite attempts like Marcus Hutter’s <a class="af nc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIXI" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">AIXI</a>. In the abstract, it can be conceived of some perfectly rational agent that solves problems by virtue of reasoning and computational power alone. The cleavage between information and embodiment is a gambit for a much wider discussion that is beyond the scope of this article. If interested, this <a class="af nc" href="https://evanthompson.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/pcs-life-and-mind.pdf" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">paper</a> provides a good starting point.</p><p id="a6e0" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ob oc fq od b go ou of og gr ov oi oj no ow ol om ns ox oo op nw oy or os ot fj bk">However, there are good reasons to doubt that reinforcement learning suffices for artificial general intelligence. Some reasons for this include the very definition of general intelligence. Most current AI researchers still rely on a behaviourist conception of intelligence without factoring explicit internal representations as necessary ingredients. And they have good reason to think so. Symbolic AI, in which hopes of general AI were pinned before the success of deep learning, proved to be a failure. Symbolic AI refers to approaches to artificial intelligence based primarily on explicitly coded logical rules and knowledge stores for optimal inference generation.</p><p id="6db0" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ob oc fq od b go ou of og gr ov oi oj no ow ol om ns ox oo op nw oy or os ot fj bk">The tension between symbolic AI and neural networks may, however, be unfounded. Many researchers believe that the quest for artificial general intelligence lies in combining these approaches in the right way. Reasons for thinking that neural nets approximate the native ontology of the brain include the fact that mathematical logic is not quite how the brain reasons: that is, it doesn’t compute necessary and sufficient conditions, or crisp membership, as much as graded membership, which is approximated by the likes of fuzzy logic and at which ANNs excel.</p><p id="4480" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ob oc fq od b go ou of og gr ov oi oj no ow ol om ns ox oo op nw oy or os ot fj bk">Neural networks consist of a black-box hierarchical architecture of hidden layers parametrized to achieve the desired output through highly calibrated dynamic learning rates, activation functions, connection weights, and optimization algorithms calibrated to minimize error. Beyond highly calibrated hyperparameters like the above, the human designer does not understand how information is processed in the hidden layers. The assumption is that the same is the case with the brain, where information is not stored as combinations of discrete representational units (whether analog or imagistic) but as a vast, distributed architecture of billions of neurons. What we think of as linguistically structured thoughts are not internally represented in the brain that way at all: there’s no specific combination of neurons that stand for the word <em class="oz">being</em> or the sentence “<em class="oz">Existence as determinate being is in essence being for another”</em> for example.</p><p id="a8ef" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ob oc fq od b go ou of og gr ov oi oj no ow ol om ns ox oo op nw oy or os ot fj bk">Linguistic competence is instead embedded in a vast network of semantic connections and reproduction rules reinforced through experience and augmented by imagistic and analog representations. In other words, language and thought as we represent them reflectively, but also behaviourally in writing and speech, do not have brain analogues that mirror their explicit structure (in other words, isomorphic mapping between grammar and the native ontology of the brain), but are instead embedded in distributed networks of neural assemblies characterized by degrees of connectivity and connection strengths.</p><p id="afea" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ob oc fq od b go ou of og gr ov oi oj no ow ol om ns ox oo op nw oy or os ot fj bk">On the other hand, it seems that neural nets seem unable to instantiate the structured thought-processes that some argue are the seat of reason and human intelligence. After all, explicit reasoning constitutes the chief means of human intellectual achievement, and this does not appear to be something that current neural nets are able to replicate. A salient illustration comes from Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems, where a formal system alone cannot establish the truth of certain statements on the basis of proof alone. (<a class="af nc" href="https://angjelinhila.medium.com/alethic-limits-set-theory-entscheidungsproblem-turing-computability-ed0ed282b026" rel="noopener">If interested, check out this article that I wrote that explains Godel’s proof</a>). Meanwhile, the human subject can verify the truth of such a statement despite failure of axiomatic deduction. Foregoing the complicated and contested implications of this uncoupling of truth and proof for computation, it is additionally worth noting that the human agent actively pursues theories of the world, whereas current RL algorithms do so in a very rudimentary sense, though robotics will likely eventually advance toward similar capabilities. Meanwhile the linguistic state of the art, LLMs, regurgitate linguistically indistinguishable analogues to human speech and writing when prompted while exhibiting exponentially faster recall speeds and stores of information orders of magnitude larger. Much hangs in the balance of understanding this distinction: humans actively pursue theories of the world as well as other creative pursuits as part of their cultural programming, which co-opts mechanisms tailored toward survival and reproductive success. In other words, all human activity occurs within the basin of evolutionary constraints. As such, humans and all living organisms, constitute autonomous systems that replicate and endogenously reproduce their own identity conditions. Human and animal intelligence are therefore inextricable from the boundary conditions of survival, barring any measure of cultural independence from strict adaptationism (<a class="af nc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociobiology" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">a big topic which engenders wide disagreement</a>).</p><p id="cf8e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ob oc fq od b go ou of og gr ov oi oj no ow ol om ns ox oo op nw oy or os ot fj bk">Current AI does not approximate autonomous systems that endogenously propel themselves in the world. Nor do they generate their own environmental milieu and reconfigure their own search spaces in the way humans and other animals do. The absence of this constraint currently allows the human designer to set AI’s informational salience, e.g. text-generation, environmental detection etc. Even if the architecture evolves into a bona fide general problem-solving machine, unless it becomes capable of reflective awareness it cannot be said to possess general intelligence. Definitions of general intelligence canonically omit the variable of global awareness — the equivalent to what the ancient Greeks termed <strong class="od fr"><em class="oz">nous</em></strong> — as the hallmark of human intelligence. They do so because reflective and global awareness remain recalcitrant to reverse engineering and analysis into parts. For this reason, reflective awareness is dismissed as an ingredient of intelligence. However, admitting recalcitrance to current scientific explanation does not by the same token imply rejecting physicalism or an an endorsement of non-naturalism. Rather, it signals admission of lack of understanding. Given this gap in understanding, I hypothesize that reflective awareness is an extension of sentience which is a fundamental property of living organisms. In asserting this, I do not imply that autonomous systems cannot be engineered through means other than natural selection, though I leave open the possibility that they may remain opaque to scientific analysis in the foreseeable future. If reinforcement learning hopes to amount to general intelligence, the agent should posses as a prior a powerful architecture that not only hosts complex representations of the world, but maintains a global view from the inside of those very representations. This means that while model-world interactivity is indispensable to the task, the native architecture will require a complex hierarchical internal structure with capacities for multi-modal information processing and integration.</p><h2 id="2ee0" class="nd ne fq bf nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa bk"><strong class="al">Selected References</strong></h2><p id="78b1" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ob oc fq od b go oe of og gr oh oi oj no ok ol om ns on oo op nw oq or os ot fj bk">Mnih, V., Kavukcuoglu, K., Silver, D., Rusu, A.
