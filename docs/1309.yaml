- en: Anyone who has ever studied probability has heard of the long-established definition
    of probability of “*Probability can be defined as the number of favorable outcomes
    divided by the total number outcomes*.” I can still hear my 4th grade teacher
    reiterating this!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While this definition is **correct**, it often makes me wonder, how **accurate**
    is this definition for the real-world? How accurate is it when we have some **more
    information** about the favorable outcomes? To put it more clearly, when we have
    some more “**conditions**” to put to our favorable outcomes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Putting “**conditions**” is like slicing your original pie of number of favorable
    outcomes in a number of ways, using multiple conditions, to give you the slice
    that represents the number of favorable outcomes for you more truly. The image
    below attempts to depict this concept in a very brief manner.

    let’s do a quick recap of the definitions.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now consider two events A and B. The foundation of conditional probability is
    when there is an “event given another event”. In this case, when one says **A
    given B**, what that means is the event A occurring **given** event B has occurred.
    So that is attaching the “**condition of B, to A**”.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: P(A|B) = P(A intersection B) / P(B) where
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: P(A intersection B)* is given as the probability of both event A and event B
    occurring.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**given (A intersection B) and (A’ intersection B) are mutually exclusive.
    Hence (A intersection B) union (A’ intersection B) = B.*'

    conditional probability is actually better.

    refining we can do with any additional information that we are provided. In real

    add conditions to make your probabilities more accurate.
