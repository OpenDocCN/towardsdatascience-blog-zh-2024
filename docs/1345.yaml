- en: Imagine you are trying to teach a dog to fetch a ball. At first, the dog has
    no idea what to do when you throw the ball. It might run in different directions,
    ignore the ball, or do something completely unrelated. Your goal is to teach the
    dog the best way to fetch the ball and bring it back to you.

- en: Each time the dog does something, you either reward it with a treat or do nothing.
    If the dog runs toward the ball, you give it a treat. If it does something else,
    you don’t. This set of guidelines or strategies that the dog follows to decide
    what to do is called a policy. Initially, these guidelines are random, but with
    training, they become more focused on fetching the ball.

- en: Over time, the dog learns that running towards the ball results in treats. It
    starts to follow this strategy more often because it leads to rewards. This is
    essentially how Policy Gradient Methods work. In this article, we will explore
    their mechanisms and math, and we will use the OpenAI Gym to train a car to drive
    across mountains. Let’s get started!
