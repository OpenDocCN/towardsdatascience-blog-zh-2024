    edge. There is, however, no bullet-proof certainty that these choices will turn

    process aims to shorten your odds, i.e. to maximize the probability of success,

    to charter data-related choices to the sales leader, such that sales commits to
    use the AI-driven insights within its planning process. This means that ‘AI-driven
    sales planning’ becomes a Must-Have Capability of the sales strategy.

- en: The relevance of good business strategy for successful data value creation appears
    to be underestimated and undervalued. Companies must have a well-defined, explicit
    business strategy, from which any data, analytics and AI demands are apparent.
    This strategic foundation is the starting point for chartering data-related choices,
    whether in dedicated data management, analytics, or AI functions, and for building
    the necessary capabilities across business units.

    foundation. Otherwise, you will likely run into troubles and will experience the
    symptoms of dysfunctional data value creation, which we all know too well.

- en: Looking ahead, the competitive landscape is evolving rapidly. The most successful
    organizations of the future will be those that recognize data as a strategic asset,
    not just a byproduct of their operations. As AI technologies mature and integrate
    further into business processes, companies with a coherent strategy will be poised
    to capitalize on these advancements, creating new revenue streams, driving innovation,
    and maintaining a sustainable edge over their competition. In the coming years,
    we will see a growing divide between companies that have laid the strategic groundwork
    for data and AI and those that continue with business as usual. The former will
    thrive, while the latter may struggle to survive in an increasingly data-driven
    world.
