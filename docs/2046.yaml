- en: Most data scientists naturally gravitate towards the fun parts of data science
    — developing a technically advanced, sophisticated machine learning model. However,
    a good chunk of data science managers invest too much time in a model’s technical
    design, and don’t invest enough time in developing deeper understanding of the
    business problem the model is intended to solve. As a result, technically successful
    projects are deployed into production, only to fall short of delivering the anticipated
    business value and taking it’s permanent home in what I like to call the `data
    science graveyard`. As a data science manager of a large team, I’ve buried more
    projects in that graveyard than I care to admit. However, these experiences have
    taught me valuable lessons about ensuring data science projects generate real
    business value. In this article, I’ll share the four important lessons that data
    science managers can use to ensure that data science projects generate clear and
    meaningful business impact.
