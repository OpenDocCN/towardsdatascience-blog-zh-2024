- en: 'Artificial intelligence, data science and analytics: these functions or data
    products tend to get the most airtime and attention when we think about whether
    our organisation is data-driven. A focus on sophistication and maturity goes hand-in-hand
    with assessing the newest technologies and approaches. As is the case in other
    disciplines and industries we can overlook the workhorses that are always there
    and used by many instead of the chosen few.'

    business intelligence first. This is not because I don’t think analytics or modelling
    teams are important. It is because culture goes much deeper than job titles, formal
    teams, or expensive projects, and into the DNA of how every single employee thinks
    about and uses data. The reports we rely on and the metrics we monitor are the
    lions share of the “data-driven decision making” in our organisation. The pipelines
    and sources of truth that make up our business and operational foundations are
    how data really flows through the company. If we don’t understand that the rest
    is just noise.

    data teams have the opportunity to really amplify the effectiveness of data in
    their organisation if they focus first on making the core metrics matter.
