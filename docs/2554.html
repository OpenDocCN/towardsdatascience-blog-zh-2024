href="https://workweek.com/2023/09/27/gallups-workplace-2023-report-is-here/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">77% of employees are either not engaged or actively disengaged with their jobs</a>? That’s right — most of us have a job that doesn’t truly fulfill us. Considering that the average person spends about 90,000 hours at work over their lifetime, it becomes important to find a career that you enjoy.</p><p id="36ac" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Imagine spending those 90,000 hours doing something that excites, challenges you, and gives you a sense of purpose. It might have a significant effect on your general well-being. But for many people, finding a job they love feels out of reach. All these obstacles seem impossible to overcome.</p><p id="762c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Perhaps you can relate. You’ve made an effort to change to a career you love. You’ve networked, tweaked your resume countless times, and read every career advice article you could find. Yet, that dream job still feels out of reach. You’re asking yourself: “Am I doing something wrong?”</p><p id="3624" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">If this sounds familiar, you’re not the only one. Perhaps you’ve made those <a class="af nc" href="https://medium.com/towards-data-science/how-i-improved-my-productivity-as-a-data-scientist-with-two-small-habits-de09854d553c" rel="noopener">two small changes that increased your productivity</a>. They increased your job satisfaction, but it wasn’t enough.</p><p id="419e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">But what if I told you it might be simpler than you think to get into a career you love? What if there are only a few minor changes rather than a lack of abilities? These few adjustments could be exactly what you need to turn your aspirations into a tangible reality.</p><p id="092e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">That’s where my story comes in. On my way to becoming a data scientist several years ago, I found something unexpected: a small change that made all the difference. I was able to recognize new opportunities and advance in data science because of this minor change in perspective.</p><p id="1a08" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">The best part? It can be applied for any job you want, not just data science.</p></div></div></div><div class="ab cb nz oa ob oc" role="separator"><span class="od by bm oe of og"/><span class="od by bm oe of og"/><span class="od by bm oe of"/></div><div class="fj fk fl fm fn"><div class="ab cb"><div class="ci bh ev ew ex ey"><p id="de8b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple Inc., was a visionary who transformed the technology industry. He was key in the development of leading products such as the iPhone, iPad, and Macintosh. We all use technology differently as a result of those products, even today.</p><p id="62e1" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Jobs understood what users wanted and had a gift for design.</p><p id="31ba" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">That’s what set Apple apart.

It was also about creating beautiful products that people enjoyed using.</p><p id="31af" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">He always advocated going after your passion no matter where life took you. He shared a line about that in his well-known 2005 Stanford speech: “<a class="af nc" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JV3OqaRmBk4" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">The only way to do great work is to love what you do.</a>” This idea wasn’t only influential in his own life.

He said once: “In the world of business, the people who are most successful are those who are doing what they love.” He has worked to turn Berkshire Hathaway into a business empire and did just that throughout his career.</p><p id="b9f9" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">The list goes on. <a class="af nc" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBWStmXMnUM" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Oprah Winfrey</a> shares the same idea, as well as <a class="af nc" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ksFwAMa3qQ" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Richard Branson</a>.</p><p id="4a53" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">I know what you’re thinking. You have heard before the “follow your passion” advice. It shows up on inspirational posters and has been repeated many times. Maybe you’ve even tried to find your passion but gave up out of frustration. But what if you’ve been looking at it all wrong?</p><p id="68a1" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">The reality is that following your passions alone will most likely not lead you to a fulfilling career. It’s about finding that “spot” where <strong class="nf fr">your unique skills and passions meet. </strong>These are the unique abilities that set you apart.</p><p id="c246" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">That subtle shift changed everything for me.

Given most small businesses close within a few years, I find it interesting how they can compete against large corporations. The way companies make money intrigues me. Occasionally even loss leaders are used to draw consumers before earning from particular goods or services.</p><p id="e2a6" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Once I spot these “high-potential opportunities, my passion for technology kicks in.

Start spending more time on activities you truly enjoy — even if it’s as little as 10% or 20% of your time! This is a start. Even if it requires extra work now, it will pay off in the long term.</p><p id="cc30" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">In one of my previous jobs, our team was spending countless hours on manual tasks, like copying and pasting data in Excel sheets.</p><p id="3bc8" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">My boss didn’t ask for a solution, but I decided to automate these tasks using Python, something I like doing and am good at.
