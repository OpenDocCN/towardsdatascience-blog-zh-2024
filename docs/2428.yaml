- en: I was sketching out architectural recommendations for a client project that,
    after a successful POC, was ready for the prime-time of production software. I
    stopped to ask myself *why* the new arch diagram I was creating looked vastly
    different from the architecture of the existing concept software; even when my
    answers seemed solid (they included specific measures of reliability, speed, scale,
    and security), I could not shake the feeling that this felt familiar in a bad
    way. I counted the number of replatforms I have either been directly responsible
    for (i.e. several Modern Data Stack conversions) or indirectly impacted by (Data
    Warehouse reconciliations between the “old” and “new” systems) over the last fifteen
    years. I came up with thirteen replatforms. Of those thirteen, only four eventually
    yielded positive product or engineering outcomes; that is a **roughly 70% failure
    rate** among replatforms I have personally witnessed. It is no wonder that anything
    resembling a re-write, re-architecture, or re-thinking gives me immediate pause.

    executive careers, mark the hockey stick inflection point for an organization’s
