- en: Hi, I am Jubayer Hossain, a master's student at FAU-Erlangen. My program in
    ElectroMobility consists of courses in mechanical studies, AI, and programming.
    This semester I took 2 courses that focus on Open book examinations with all the
    contents of the lectures provided.

    implement an RAG-based open-source LLM with the help of Langchain to help me with
    content searching and better prepare me for the exam.

    are about 16 pdf slides which I downloaded manually. Of course, I could write
    a script that will automatically download all the slides but for only 16, we can
    agree that it will be faster manually.'
