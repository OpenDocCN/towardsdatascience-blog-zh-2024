- en: To state the obvious, data science has evolved into one of the most sought-after
    skill sets in the market over the past decade. Traditional corporations, technology
    companies, consulting firms, start-up businesses — you name it — are continually
    hiring data science professionals. High demand and a relatively short supply of
    experienced experts in this space make this a very lucrative career opportunity.
    To break into and be successful in this area, you need a deep understanding of
    not just the available algorithms and packages but also develop an intuition around
    which methods lend themselves to which use cases. Plus you’ll need to learn how
    to translate a real-world problem to a data science framework. In this post, I’ll
    talk about how beginners can build a fundamental and deep understanding of this
    space to initiate a career in this area.

    as to what to pick as a learning mechanism. While it would depend on your individual
    situation and objective, you may want to consider a few criteria when selecting
    a learning resource:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '· *Content*: typically, a robust resource will cover supervised learning (e.g.
    linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, ensemble methods), unsupervised
    learning (e.g. clustering, PCA), as well as basics around statistics and probability.
    Many programs have focused modules on advanced methods including Deep Learning,
    Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Generative AI. Some programs
    even offer free previews of the course contents, learning videos, and coding projects
    to help learners make a decision. While it may be challenging to find a program
    that includes every topic in detail, your purpose for pivoting into the data science
    domain should dictate the choice of the coursework.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '· *Audience*: “Who will benefit from the coursework?” is a key question to
    help with the determination of a program. If you are a beginner, intermediate
    level courses may prove to be a barrier to learning. On the flip side, very basic
    concepts may be less useful for learners who already have some background in analytical
    methods.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '· *Time commitment*: depending on your individual situation and preferences,
    this consideration may narrow the options you may have. For instance, if you are
    a working professional, you may not be able to spend beyond a few hours a week.
    Many online programs offer flexible timings with an expected 5–7 hours of work
    per week targeted at part-time learners. Overall time spent in a program also
    determines how much skill development occurs. While advanced programs at universities
    (e.g. master’s in data science) may serve to develop deeper expertise over 18–24
    months and may require several hours of dedicated effort during a week, shorter
    courses over 4–6 weeks may not be helpful in developing the necessary skills to
    kickstart a new career.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '· *Learner experience*: you may find user reviews on the program page or at
    other locations online. These can be helpful in getting a feel for the quality
    of course content and teaching, especially if there’s a sizeable number of ratings
    as well as comments. Further, the reach of the program is indicated by the number
    of learners that are either currently enrolled and/or those who have completed
    it. One could argue that verifying the validity of reviews and number of learners
    may be challenging. Even so, these can serve as triangulation points, given other
    information, for looking at a program holistically.'

    range from being free of charge to running into thousands of dollars.'

    and career switch, including interview prep, resume reviews, and networking with
    domain experts in industry. While this may not be a primary consideration regarding
    choice of a program, these can help get a foot in the door as you start on the
    career change journey.'

    topics, I would recommend for beginners to consider a structured pathway that
    provides a comprehensive view of the data science area. Based on my experience,
    I would recommend choosing from three types of programs, at least initially (one
    can always supplement the learning with additional material on individual topics):'

    offer a balance between single/short courses that may not be sufficient to develop
    the required acumen in data science, and formal education that may take more than
    a year. EdTech companies regularly offer these programs, oftentimes, in collaboration
    with highly regarded universities. A side-by-side comparison across the selection
    criteria can be helpful in deciding on a path forward — Figure 1 shows an example
    comparison of specializations and professional certificates. The courses listed
    here are only a small sample of the variety of programs online and are by no means
    exhaustive. Furthermore, the details presented for each program are from a particular
    point in time and may change.

    it may take multiple courses to feel comfortable with the subject. In my own case,
    I started with Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning [course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction).
    It covered the fundamentals in good detail but as the course had exercises in
    Matlab/Octave at that time, I decided to do another [course](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science)
    from IBM to learn Python along with AI/ML. Based on my personal learning preference,
    I felt the need for a more formal mechanism of instruction and decided to go with
    a Post Graduate [Program](https://onlineexeced.mccombs.utexas.edu/online-ai-machine-learning-course)
    in AI/ML from the University of Texas at Austin in collaboration with *Great Learning*.
    This provided me with more structure as I had theory to learn from video modules
    taking up to 5–7 hours per week, take weekly quizzes, attend an online mentor-led
    group interactive session for a couple of hours every weekend, and code submissions
    every few weeks. While the theory and quizzes helped me gain an understanding
    of the concepts, the hands-on code development was really my key to internalizing
    the learning. This exercise gave me fundamental insights on how to set up the
    problem, clean and analyze raw data, determine which algorithm to apply, refine
    the solution, and explain the results.

    journey. As a beginner, it may be prudent to consider a more structured learning
    pathway, and then deep dive into specific areas once you have a fair understanding
    of the basics. Spending time upfront in researching and benchmarking programs
    can also help learners understand the key and in-demand topics within the data
    science realm.
