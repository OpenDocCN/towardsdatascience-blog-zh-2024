    skills. Oh, and you can do it in Python

    job as “just backend stuff”. Within the Data Science/AI hype bubble, we’re used
    to thinking about AI as *the* defining technology of our times; sort of like the
    thing around which the rest of the tech Solar System orbits.

    of the hype bubble, AI is just one piece of the puzzle, not the centre of the
    universe. This sparked a curiosity in me to try and learn more about other “planets”
    in the tech “Solar System”, and I eventually decided to learn web development,
    for four reasons:'
