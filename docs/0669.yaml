    a Gemini testing plan myself, and artificially limiting myself to 30 minutes.
    As you’ll see below, even in that incredibly “rushed environment”, this plan would
    have caught some glaring issues in the AI model. If you are curious why they were
    rushing, check out my post on [Google’s AI Strategy Flaws](https://medium.com/@4thewinn/googles-ai-strategy-flaws-an-ex-googler-s-view-on-the-gemini-failure-26038af5c968).

    post launch. Instead I’ll adopt the mindset of any PM trying to anticipate general
    issues **before** a launch. For example, I wouldn’t have thought to include a
    test prompt to [generate an image of Nazis](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/21/24079371/google-ai-gemini-generative-inaccurate-historical),
    so I’m not going to include those in my plan.

- en: In cases where a prompt returns many results all skewing towards one demographic
    (when no demographic is specified) I would propose scanning results with a bias
    detection model. When this was seen, additional images generated with the diverse
    prompt rewriting could be added to the response.

    for a long time. Monitoring this and being open with the user when it occurs could
    be a viable solution in the meantime.

    of six women.

    use. These might be fine for something informal like my Medium blog or social
    media posts. However, if a larger business needed images for advertising or a
    professional publication I would recommend they use [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home)
    instead.

    actively working on, but it would still be important to track in any quality evaluation.

    A list of prompts is an essential starting point, but is just the beginning of
    the testing journey.

    by not letting people control the subjects in their photos, it didn’t support
    the most common use cases for image generation.

    of white people](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/22/technology/google-gemini-german-uniforms.html)
    is such a weird outcome, worthy of the [TV show Silicon Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series)).
    This leads me to believe it wasn’t intended by Google leadership. Most likely
    this was due to a rushed addition of diversity inserting prompt rewriting shortly
    before launch (described [here](https://www.piratewires.com/p/google-culture-of-fear))
    followed by inadequate testing as Sergey claimed. Diversity inserting prompt rewriting
    can be used effectively as we saw with OpenAI, but [the Gemini implementation
    was a hot mess](https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-image-generation-issue/).
