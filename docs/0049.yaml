- en: In this story, I would like to talk about the essential skills and knowledge
    I would want to equip myself fifteen years ago to succeed in the data engineering
    space. Leadership role in engineering requires more technical focus and hands-on
    activities to guide the dev team towards that optimal and desired outcome set
    as a project goal. There is a lot to discuss in architecture and technical standards,
    communicating effectively with major stakeholders, and ensuring that projects
    are delivered to a high degree of technical quality. Ideally, I would like to
    rewind fifteen years of my career back and see what I need to become a successful
    data engineering lead. Throughout my almost fifteen-year career in analytics and
    tech, I have seen many things. This story is a summary of lessons I have learned.

    and within the budget.
