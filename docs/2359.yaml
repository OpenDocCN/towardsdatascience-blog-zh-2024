- en: Data Science and AI professionals usually spend a significant amount of time
    gathering data, cleaning it, preparing it, and choosing the perfect algorithm
    while building a machine learning model to generate predictions. However, the
    model performance does not always seem to meet the desired expectations. This
    happens because an important step has not been covered after setting up the baseline
    model. Yes, you are thinking correctly — tuning the hyperparameters which are
    the settings that guide our model to learn and make better predictions. Sometimes,
    even after using powerful machine learning algorithms, the model cannot perform
    well as its hyperparameters are not fine-tuned. However, manually searching for
    the best set of hyperparameters and applying them can be boring as well as time-consuming.
    So what is ***Hyperparameter Tuning***, and why is it important to know when developing
    ML models?
