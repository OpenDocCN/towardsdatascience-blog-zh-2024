- en: 'The true power of Generative AI is realized when it helps people simplify or
    automate day to day activities and tasks. Some examples of these tasks include:
    email/message summarization, resume builders, and more. Specifically, this past
    week I was trying to plan an interesting date night for my girlfriend and I realized
    there was no set tool that could give an end to end date idea depending on both
    of our interests.'

- en: Sure I could use Google and stitch together a bunch of different places, but
    this took time and a lot of research (I also always end up on Reddit lol). Alternatively,
    I tried using something like ChatGPT directly, but realized a lot of the suggestions
    included places that were more outdated and didn’t really contain the latest and
    greatest suggestions due to the model being trained at an earlier time.

- en: In one of my [previous articles](/generate-music-recommendations-utilizing-langchain-agents-d0e531de95df),
    we discussed how we could generate music recommendations using [LangChain Agents](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/)
    in conjunction with the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api).
    Today we’ll take not just a different API, but a slightly different approach than
    the Agent driven solution we followed in the music recommendation solution to
    curate date night ideas.
