- en: Experimentation **does not always need to be complex**; simple A/B test framework
    could be just excellent in situations with manageable marketing levers. The design
    and implementation of experimentation should always go hand in hand with marketing
    learning agenda, marketing technology (MarTech) maturity, and creative design
    capability.

- en: Let’s take grocery shopping as an example. To understand impacts of one-time
    promotions and offerings on online grocery shoppers, a simple A/B test framework
    of control and test variants will do. It matters less if these shoppers are assigned
    to consistent control and test groups throughout their customer life journey,
    nor if a few of them dropped out midway.

    studying causal relationships over time. Unlike one-time experiments, they allow
    for the examination of evolving patterns and trends within a population or sample
    group. Traditionally prominent in fields like medical sciences and economics,
    longitudinal experiments have found increasing use cases in sectors including
    tech, retail, banking, and insurance.

    bike parts for mountain cyclists to customize and upgrade their bikes. They recently
    launched a personalization program to send weekly best offerings and promotions
    to their loyal cyclist customer base.

- en: AvidBikers implements a **dual-layered longitudinal experimentation framework**
    to track the overall personalization program-wide impacts as well as impacts from
    individual campaigns. Here program-wide effects refer to the impacts from running
    the personalization program, sometime consists of up to thousands of individual
    campaigns, whereas campaign-level impacts refer to that of sending personalized
    weekly best offerings vs. promotions to most relevant customers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To implement the framework, test and control groups are created on both global
    level and campaign level. Global test group is the customer base who receives
    personalized offerings and promos when eligible, whereas global control is carved
    out as “hold-out” group. Within the global test group, we further carve out campaign-level
    test and control groups to measure impacts of different personalization strategies.

    test-control group balance**. For one, customer attrition likely has an uneven
    impact on test and control groups, creating uncontrolled differences that could
    not be attributed to the personalization treatment / interventions.

- en: To address such bias, new customers are assigned into program-level and campaign
    level test and control groups, followed by a statistical test to validate groups
    are balanced. In addition, a **longitudinal quality check** will be run to ensure
    audience assignment is consistent week over week.

- en: Measurement is often (*mistakenly*) used interchangeably with experimentation.
    The difference, in simple terms, is that experimentations are frameworks to test
    hypotheses and identify causal relationship whereas measurement is the collection
    and quantification of observed data points.

- en: Measurement is key to **capturing learnings and financial impacts of company
    endeavors**. Similarly to experimentation, AvidBikers prepared program and campaign-level
    measurement files to run statistical tests to understand program and campaign-level
    performance and impacts. Program-level measurement results indicate the overall
    success of AvidBikers personalization program. On the other hand, campaign-level
    measurement tells us which specific personalization tactic (personalized offering
    or promo) is the winning strategy for which subset of the customer base.

    their marketing and pricing teams to find the best personalization tactics through
    numerous fast “test-and-learn” cycles.

- en: Implementing longitudinal experiments at scale demands a balance of technological
    infrastructure and methodological rigor. Tools like Airflow and Databricks streamline
    workflow management and data processing, facilitating the orchestration of complex
    experiments. Nevertheless, the cornerstone of success remains the **meticulous
    design and execution of the experimentation framework** tailored to the specific
    business context.

- en: In my personal experience, complexities such as **cold-start, customer dropouts,
    and overlapping strategies** could arise, which require case-by-case evaluation
    and customization in experiment design and implementation. However, as customer
    needs continue to evolve, strategic implementation of longitudinal experiments
    stands as a pivotal foundation in the evolution of customer-centric personalization.
