In the UK there isn’t a centralised place for employment statistics, so it’s far from obvious what data the author is referring to. You might be content with dismissing the data and thus dismissing the rest of the article, since its premise is based on this data. However, I’m a try-hard, so I put on my best Sherlock Holmes hat and set about finding the un-cited data.</p><p id="43d4" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Sadly, I am not Sherlock Holmes. Despite considerable online sleuthing, I couldn’t find any data that matched the article’s. I did, however, find other “employment stats”. Specifically the Office of National Statistics (ONS)’s <a class="af nc" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peoplenotinwork/unemployment" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">measure of unemployment</a> by region. It paints a very different picture. In fact the polar opposite picture! Of the three areas the article highlights as having reduced in employment since 2011, the ONS in fact finds they all increased!* I’m afraid the only unfashionable truth illuminated by this article is the degradation of news media.

In case you didn’t quite understand the quote, since it is written in the classic academic obfuscation style, the quote is saying that signing your name on the top of a document makes you less likely to lie about the document than if you had signed on the bottom.</p><p id="5af2" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">The data came from a collection of researchers based in highly regarded universities, most notably Francesca Gino who was a professor at Harvard Business School at the time of publication. For me, this passes our first question about the data (‘Where did the data come from?’).</p><p id="d90e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Next we need to ask: ‘Would the data be presented if the opposite result were true?’ To answer this we first need to understand a little about the people and/or institutes presenting the data. In this case it is a group of Behavioural Science academics. Academia is a cut-throat industry, with an exceptionally <a class="af nc" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAOs-frRfa4&amp;t=285s" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">high failure rate</a>. Therefore, it is critical for academics to be considered ‘successful’ as early as possible to avoid being culled. The key factor to determine an academic’s success is, unsurprisingly, their work. But how do you measure the quality of their work? A common method is <a class="af nc" href="https://www.stjude.org/research/progress/2020/the-benefits-of-being-highly-cited.html#:~:text=The%20more%20citations%20you%20have,based%20on%20their%20impact%20factor." rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">citation count</a>, that is the number of times an academic’s work is mentioned in the work of other academics.</p><p id="e0f3" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">The issue with this is you are far more likely to to be cited if you have an unexpected/interesting result in your paper. Going back to the original quote, do you think a result where there was no difference in honesty between the group who signed at the top vs the bottom of a document would have been nearly as influential? No, because that would have been the expectation. The conclusion is that there is a strong incentive for academics to generate unexpected/interesting results. Therefore, in our example, we should understand that there is a strong bias for the authors to claim a (significant) difference in honesty between the two groups.</p><p id="bb32" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">This sort of bias is so strong that it has led the <a class="af nc" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-39054778" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">majority of scientific research to be unreproducible by fellow academics</a>. Unreproducible means an academic writes a research paper that copies another academic’s research paper’s method/experiment, but ends up with significantly different results to the original paper. Turning once more to our case study as an example, following the impactful success of the research paper, a number of other studies attempted to run the same or similar experiment. <a class="af nc" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1911695117" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">All results</a> of the experiments found no correlation between honesty and location of document signature. It turned out the original paper’s finding was very likely the result of <a class="af nc" href="https://datacolada.org/109" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">data fraud</a>. As were a <a class="af nc" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNK4nXWA_s8" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">number of other influential papers</a> co-authored by the prestigious Harvard professor, Francesca Gino.</p><p id="14d6" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">This sort of skin-in-the-game bias isn’t only found in academia. From <a class="af nc" href="https://www.starburst.io/blog/lie-5-vendor-benchmarks-measure-real-world-performance/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">tech vendors posting their latest performances vs competitors</a>, to investment banks presenting to prospective clients that they are no. 1 in the league tables*, bias is rife. And it isn’t only other people you should be concerned about. The strongest bias of all is most likely you—yes, YOU. Commonly referred to as confirmation bias, it is the tendency to search for, interpret, favour, and recall information in a way that confirms or supports your prior beliefs.</p><p id="3444" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Ever wondered why such a mass of people could be so stupid on so many political topics?

The article cites their data from another prestigious organisation, the Institute of Fiscal Studies. You may want to delve deeper into the exact report of the data source, but for a surface-level analysis, I’m happy with where this raw data has come from.</p><p id="ca4c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Second we want to ask ourselves, ‘would this information be presented if the opposite result was true?’ Given the BBC has (to my knowledge) no reason to support higher education institutions, it’s fair to assume that the BBC would have published an article highlighting no financial benefits to studying at university if the data suggested it.</p><p id="876d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">However, unfortunately, we still can’t trust the BBC’s findings just yet. We have one final important question to ask: ‘Does the analysis make sense?’ After looking at the <a class="af nc" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-41693230" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">article</a>’s chart on average earnings by subject, have a go at answering the following question before moving on to the next paragraph: ‘Given people with Medicine degrees earn more than the average degree, does it make sense to assume that the Medicine degree was the cause of the higher salary?’</p><p id="63a6" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">My answer: Medicine degrees are necessary to become qualified doctors, and doctors generally earn a high income. This supports the idea that a Medicine degree is the specific reason for average higher future earnings. On the other hand, you don’t just need to pick Medicine, you also need to <em class="py">be</em> picked for Medicine. Given the average A-level results for a UK Medicine graduate is an outstanding <a class="af nc" href="https://www.medify.co.uk/blog/a-level-requirements#:~:text=Most%20medical%20schools%20require%20AAA,each%20medical%20school%20requires%20below.&amp;text=A*AA%20(AAA%20considered%20if,biology%20and%20EPQ%20grade%20B)" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">AAA</a>, you could argue the reason for the high average salaries is because the average Medicine student is exceptionally cognitively capable (in academia at least), which has nothing to do with whether they actually chose Medicine as a degree or not.</p><p id="197c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">What about the degree with the second highest average salary, Economics? Unlike Medicine, you don’t strictly need an Economics degree to qualify for any specific high-paying jobs. I’d argue an Economics degree is much less likely a direct factor in increasing a graduate’s future salary. For example, someone who is genuinely interested in money at school will be more likely to base their career decisions on what pays more. That same person may also be more likely to pick Economics at university.** If that’s true, then pushing someone who is not interested in money to study Economics may not benefit their future career or financial prospects as much as the article is implying.</p><p id="420e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Similarly, someone who earns a university degree in general may be little to no better off than if they hadn’t gone to university at all. It may simply be a side effect. For example, in the UK <a class="af nc" href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9195/#:~:text=Pupils%20eligible%20for%20free%20school,second%20year%20in%20higher%20education." rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">children with wealthy parents are significantly more likely to attend university</a>. The wealth of their parents may also have an impact on the child’s high-paying job prospects; for example, they might provide invaluable knowledge to their children on how to interview, climb the greasy corporate ladder, and/or network. Given this thought process, the article’s finding that “For most university graduates, having a degree pays” is, at the very least, not a proven fact, and should not be treated as such.</p><p id="c905" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Deciding what ‘makes sense’ is subjective; for example, you may not have been convinced by my arguments above. However, it’s important to recognise the leaps in assumptions people make from data to insights, and to do your own ‘makes sense’ assessment before accepting them.</p><p id="bce0" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk"><em class="py">*It’s important to acknowledge the limitations of time we have on the depth of our investigation. For very serious things you will want to go deeper, but as a pragmatist, it isn’t possible for every data analysis we see.</em></p><p id="f202" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk"><em class="py">**You may be thinking: ‘hang on a minute, you didn’t provide any data to back up that theory’. And you’re right! However, often times we don’t have all the data available to us, we simply have to use our own experiences and intuition. As an Economics graduate who has also been fascinated with finance from an early age, the theory makes sense to me.</em></p><h1 id="ece8" class="oh oi fq bf oj ok ol gq om on oo gt op oq or os ot ou ov ow ox oy oz pa pb pc bk">Wrapping up</h1><p id="5e99" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go pd nh ni gr pe nk nl nm pf no np nq pg ns nt nu ph nw nx ny fj bk">In conclusion, data should not be the driver of your decisions. Like an unpredictable friend, data belongs firmly in the passenger seat, preferably with the child-lock on. They can provide suggestions, but ultimately you need to be sceptical before making any decision based off of them.</p><p id="25f1" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Remember, when looking into data, statistics, and/or research, you need to ask yourself:</p><ol class=""><li id="c685" class="nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob bk">Where did this data come from?</li><li id="4281" class="nd ne fq nf b go oc nh ni gr od nk nl nm oe no np nq of ns nt nu og nw nx ny nz oa ob bk">Would this data be presented if the opposite result were true?</li><li id="e6db" class="nd ne fq nf b go oc nh ni gr od nk nl nm oe no np nq of ns nt nu og nw nx ny nz oa ob bk">Would I consider the data if the opposite result were true?</li><li id="62bd" class="nd ne fq nf b go oc nh ni gr od nk nl nm oe no np nq of ns nt nu og nw nx ny nz oa ob bk">Is there a flaw with the leap from data to insight?</li></ol><h1 id="fd7f" class="oh oi fq bf oj ok ol gq om on oo gt op oq or os ot ou ov ow ox oy oz pa pb pc bk"><strong class="al">Final note for data scientists/analysts</strong></h1><p id="254a" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go pd nh ni gr pe nk nl nm pf no np nq pg ns nt nu ph nw nx ny fj bk">For data scientists and analysts, these questions are not just a safeguard — they’re a responsibility. As gatekeepers of data-driven insights, your role is crucial in ensuring that decisions are informed by sound reasoning, not just raw numbers and algorithms. By applying this mindset, you can avoid being that unpredictable friend in your organisation. And who know’s, one day you may even be invited into the driving seat.</p></div></div></div></div>
