    me. *“Ok, but how if you are writing a post about it?”*, you might think.

    to find a way to perform those tests quickly and smoothly at work. For many months
    I avoided these tests because I could not find any straightforward content that
    immediately *clicked* with my understanding.

- en: I have read many conceptual posts about A/B Testing, some very driven to marketing
    professionals, thus covering much more of the tasks of getting the sample size
    right and the test period. But when it comes to ***Before and After Test (***also
    referred to as Pre-Post Test, which we could say that is a type of A/B Testing),
    the knowledge is even harder to find.

    Pre-Post Test) for all of those seeking an easy tutorial to follow to perform
    this type of test using Python.
