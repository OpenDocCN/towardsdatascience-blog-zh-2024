- en: Graphs are fundamental data structures representing relationships between entities
    in various fields, including social networks, web pages, transportation networks,
    and academic connections. The relationships in these fields are different, and
    for this reason, we need to adopt different types of graphs to match the nature
    of these connections as closely as possible.

    leveraging the NumPy and NetworkX libraries. More specifically, we use NumPy to
    describe connectivity structures through adjacency matrices and NetworkX to visualize
    these structures and understand the key differences.

- en: 'Understanding the role of connectivity structures, like adjacency matrices
    (or similar data structures such as edge index tensors), is crucial for grasping
    the key ideas behind advanced graph machine learning techniques, such as Graph
    Neural Networks (GNNs). To build intuition about the role of adjacency matrices
    in GNNs, you can read the following article:'
