    listed on [arXiv](https://tableau.cornell.edu/t/PublicContent/views/arXivSubmissions/LineGraphByArchive).
    Though the works are not necessarily peer-reviewed before listing, this still
    is an enormous wealth of information. To get an impression, see the below chart
    for the growth of monthly submissions since 2009, taken from arXiv:'

    to end, on average. At the numbers listed above, **one would need 300 hours (or
    12 days!) to read through them all**. And that is just going through the papers
    of one day — the next day, we’d have to start anew; going through a similar number
    of publications again. Obviously, that’s not feasible, neither for experts nor
    for beginners.

    need to be crisp in their writing. They include an introduction to the topic,
    a method section, results, and a summary. Altogether, the content of a paper is
    a (condensed) lecturing on a single, very narrow topic. For…'
