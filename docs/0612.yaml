    products. Until recently the way to integrate with models was online/offline models
    that were developed by a data scientist, they are reliable, use-case-specific
    models, and their predictions are accessible.

    it! Product teams’ inherent understanding of the business together with the ease
    of use of GenAI allows them to build AI-driven features that boost their product
    capabilities.

    models work and how to evaluate them properly at scale they might face issues
    around results’ reliability and accuracy. This is where the data science group
    can assist and support their efforts by guiding the teams on how to safely use
    the models, create mitigation services if needed, share the latest best practices
    around new AI capabilities, evaluate their performance, and serve them at scale.

    start shifting their effort towards improving the results, this is where data
    scientists can offer advanced approaches to improve performance as they understand
    how these models work.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To conclude, the role of data science in democratizing AI is a crucial one,
    as it bridges the gap between AI technology and those who may not have extensive
    AI expertise. Through collaboration between data scientists and product teams,
    we can harness the strengths of both fields to create safe, accessible, and accurate
    AI-driven solutions that drive innovation and deliver exceptional user experiences.
    With ongoing advancements and innovations, the future of democratized AI holds
    great potential for transformative change across industries.
