    This proposed web standard is quickly gaining adoption, but what is it exactly
    and why does it matter?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While robots.txt and sitemap.xml are designed for search engines, LLMs.txt is
    optimized for reasoning engines. It provides information about a website to LLMs
    in a format they can easily understand.

    one move, they made thousands of dev tools’ docs LLM-friendly, like Anthropic
    and Cursor.
  prefs: []

    Mintlify-hosted docs joined in, creating a wave of visibility for the proposed
    standard.

- en: Jeremy Howard, co-founder of Answer.AI, proposed LLMs.txt to solve a specific
    technical challenge.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AI systems can only process limited context windows, making it difficult for
    them to understand large documentation sites. Traditional SEO techniques are optimized
    for search crawlers rather than reasoning engines, and so they can’t solve this
    limitation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When AI systems try to process HTML pages directly, they get bogged down with
    navigation elements, JavaScript, CSS, and other non-essential info that reduces
    the space available for actual content.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: LLMs.txt solves that by giving the AI the exact information it needs in a format
    it understands.
