    points. Despite this being a common machine learning task, most clustering algorithms
    do not explain the characteristics of each cluster or why a point identifies with
    a cluster, requiring users to do extensive cluster profiling. This time-consuming
    process becomes incredibly difficult as the datasets at hand grow larger and larger.
    This is ironic since one of the main uses for clustering is to discover trends
    and patterns in the data given.

- en: With these considerations in mind, wouldn’t it be nice to have an approach that
    not only clustered the data but *also* provided innate profiles of each cluster?
    Well, that's where the field of *interpretable clustering* comes into play. These
    approaches construct a model that maps points to clusters, and users are ideally
    able to analyze this model to figure out the qualities in each cluster. In this
    article, I am to discuss why this field is important as well as cover some of
    the main tracks of interpretable clustering.
