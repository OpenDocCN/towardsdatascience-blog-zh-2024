- en: In this story, I would like to speak about data engineering career paths and
    data projects that look great on any CV. If you are an aspiring data practitioner
    not only willing to learn new tools and techniques but also aiming to build your
    own data projects portfolio â€” this article is for you. During my more than 15
    years career in data and analytics, I witnessed good and bad CVs showcasing data
    engineering skills. Data engineering projects you were involved in or responsible
    for are the ultimate compass that tells a recruiter about your experience, how
    good you are and why they should hire you. This story is about how to present
    your data engineering experience in CVs and deliver that sense of professionalism
    and confidence that buy-in.

    is probably the most difficult job role in the data space. You need to be a software
    engineer â€” to know how to build data pipelines, then you need to be a data analyst
    â€” to communicate efficiently with analytics teams using SQL, and in the end, you
    need to be an experienced data platform architect to manage all required infrastructure
    resources. **Itâ€™s definitely worth the risk to start learning**â€¦
