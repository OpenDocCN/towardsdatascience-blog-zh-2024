- en: 'A few days ago, I was speaking at an event about how to move from using ChatGPT
    at a personal level to implementing AI-powered technical solutions for teams and
    companies. We covered everything from prompt engineering and fine-tuning to agents
    and function calling. One of the questions from the audience stood up to me, even
    though it was one I should have expected: *“How long does it take to get an AI-powered
    feature into production?”*'

- en: In many ways, integrating AI into features can be incredibly easy. With recent
    progress, leveraging a state-of-the-art LLM can be as simple as making an API
    call. The entry barriers to use and integrate AI are now really low. There is
    a big *but* though. Getting an AI feature into production while accounting for
    all risks linked with this new technology can be a real challenge.
