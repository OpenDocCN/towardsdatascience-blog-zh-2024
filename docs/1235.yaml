- en: Causal inference is an emerging field within machine learning that can move
    beyond predicting what could happen to explaining why it will happen and it doing
    so offers the promise of permanently resolving the underlying problem rather than
    dealing with the potential fallout.

- en: One of the key components of a causal model is a “Directed Acyclic Graph” (DAG)
    which captures the cause-and-effect relationships between variables and events
    in a simple visual format but the main issue with DAGs is that they are typically
    constructed subjectively by the domain experts.

    the calculations and conclusions of a causal inference model are likely to be
    wrong.

    a DAG against the underlying data it represents with the objective of identifying
    any mistakes or inconsistencies and fixing them and if this can be done reliably
    it will ensure that the conclusions of causal inference and the associated…'
