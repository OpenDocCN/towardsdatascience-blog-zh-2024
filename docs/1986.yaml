- en: In most tech companies, data teams must possess strong capabilities to manage
    and process big data. As a result, familiarity with the Hadoop ecosystem is essential
    for these teams. Hive Query Language (HQL), developed by Apache, is a powerful
    tool for data professionals to manipulate, query, transform, and analyze data
    within this ecosystem.

- en: HQL offers a SQL-like interface, making data processing in Hadoop both accessible
    and user-friendly for a broad range of users. If you’re already proficient in
    SQL, you’ll likely find it not challenging to transition to HQL. However, it’s
    important to note that HQL includes quite a few unique functions and features
    that aren’t available in standard SQL. In this article, I’ll explore some of these
    key HQL functions and features that require specific knowledge beyond SQL based
    on my previous experience. Understanding and utilizing these capabilities is critical
    for anyone working with Hive and big data, as they form the backbone of building
    scalable and efficient data processing pipelines and analytics systems in the
    Hadoop ecosystem. To illustrate these concepts, I’ll provide use cases with mock
    data…
