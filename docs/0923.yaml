    **M**odel) craze was immense. Straight out of Tony Stark’s lab, we finally had
    an artificial intelligence that communicated like a human. Even for the tech-initiated,
    its capabilities were shocking at first, almost frightening. Granted, LLMs had
    been around for some time by then, but GPT-3 took things to a new level.

    machine learning researchers — it would often make things up and cite “sources”
    that did not exist. ChatGPT is a disaster for academic integrity, cautioned ethicists
    — students could cheat in easier ways than ever. And, arguably most importantly,
    ChatGPT is not ethically sound, warned AI ethics researchers — much of its training
    data was full of bias, and this reflects in its responses.

    how?
