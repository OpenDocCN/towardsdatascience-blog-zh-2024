  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once upon a time I used to study Petroleum Engineering. Honestly, I was enrolled
    in a bachelor’s degree almost by accident. At school I liked Physics and Math,
    thus I definitely wanted to study STEM at the university. At that time, I didn’t
    know anything about the petroleum industry and, like many other people, I thought
    that oil was extracted from underground lakes. But because I was successfully
    accepted to this program I decided to try.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I cannot say that I regret of my choice, although I must admit that I haven’t
    worked in the industry, except the time when I was an intern. But what I got is
    the scientific approach to solving various tasks, and undoubtedly this is a great
    gift.

- en: In this post I want to emphasize the importance of knowing the scientific principles
    and laws. In most cases, they were formulated based on cumulative experience and
    long-term observations, and therefore have a high variety of applications in very
    different aspects of human lives. Data Science is not an exception, and even if
    not applying this accumulated wisdom directly, having an analogy with major scientific
    methods helps me to solve the challenging data-related tasks in a more effective
    way.

- en: The Fourier transform is a method of decomposing complicated waves or signals
    into a set of unique sinusoidal components. This decomposition allows us to examine,
    amplify, attenuate or delete each sinusoidal element.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a formal definition of the Fourier transform, from which it is clear
    that the method is all about decomposition of waves in order to simplify their
    analysis. Therefore, the Fourier transform is useful in many applications. For
    instance, music recognition services use the Fourier transform to identify songs.
    In speech recognition, the Fourier transform and related transforms are used to
    reconstruct spoken words.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition, the Fourier transform is quite useful for image processing. The
    JPEG compression algorithm is a special case of the Fourier transform used to
    remove high-frequency components from images.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Personally, I has been applied the fast Fourier transform (or just FFT) for
    creating image replicas during the reconstruction procedure — this method suits
    when we don’t have an access to micro-CT scanners, but need some binary images
    to study main properties of rock samples.

    size as the image in the frequency domain. Central vertical and horizontal strips
    of ones is set in the mask. Then the mask is applied to the shifted Fourier-transformed
    image by element-wise multiplication. After filtering, we perform an inverse FFT
    on the masked frequency data to convert it back to the spatial domain.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The superposition principle is a fundamental concept in physics and engineering,
    particularly in the fields of wave mechanics, optics, and signal processing. It
    states that when two or more waves overlap in space, the resultant wave at any
    point is the sum of the individual waves at that point. This principle applies
    to linear systems and is crucial for understanding phenomena such as interference
    and diffraction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the context of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics),
    the superposition principle can be applied to analyze various types of waves,
    including sound waves, electromagnetic waves, and quantum wave functions. It allows
    engineers and scientists to predict how waves interact with each other, which
    is essential for designing systems like communication networks, audio equipment,
    and optical devices.

    Scientist somehow knows a famous the “garbage in, garbage out” (or just GIGO)
    formula meaning that low-quality input will produce faulty output, which, I believe,
    is one of the forms of material balance in Data Science :)

- en: The GIGO principle in Data Science refers to the idea that the quality of output
    is determined by the quality of the input. If you provide poor-quality, inaccurate,
    or irrelevant data (garbage in), the results of your analysis, models, or algorithms
    will also be flawed or misleading (garbage out). This emphasizes the importance
    of data quality, cleanliness, and relevance in data science projects, as well
    as the need for proper data preprocessing and validation to ensure reliable outcomes.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: STEM background provides a robust foundation for Data Science, enhancing analytical
    skills essential for interpreting complex datasets. First, the mathematical principles
    underpinning statistics and algorithms enable data scientists to develop models
    that accurately predict trends and behaviors. Second, the scientific method fosters
    critical thinking and problem-solving abilities, allowing practitioners to formulate
    hypotheses, conduct experiments, and validate findings systematically. Finally,
    engineering principles are crucial for building scalable data infrastructures
    and optimizing performance, ensuring that data solutions are not only effective
    but also efficient. Together, these STEM disciplines empower Data Scientists to
    approach challenges with a structured mindset, driving innovation and informed
    decision-making in an increasingly data-driven world.
