- en: '[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a set of 25 programming puzzles
    released between December 1st and 25th of every year. Eric Wastl, inspired by
    the [Advent Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar), has been
    organizing the Advent of Code since 2015.'

    to write a blog post for each puzzle explaining my approach and solution to the
    problem.

- en: As I heard and read from others who participated in Advent of Code before, it
    gets really difficult after the 15th puzzle (often earlier).

    case, it’ll be a great practice on data structures and algorithms. It’s also a
    lot of fun solving puzzles and collecting stars.

- en: The puzzles can be solved using any programming language. I’ll be using Python
    because 1) I’m mostly using Python at work (my other option is R) and 2) I can
    reach a broader audience with Python.
