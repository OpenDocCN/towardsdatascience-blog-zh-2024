- en: Since you are reading this article, you are likely into data science, machine
    learning, or AI; Ultimately, you are up to programming. Programmers more often
    experience bugs, issues, and errors. That’s where things are getting serious,
    especially when working on a relatively new framework or library. At that moment,
    I always consider the benefits of having an intelligent assistant who possesses
    knowledge of various subjects and can effectively provide instruction. Once tasked,
    my assistant could go through the entire code repository, scan each line of code,
    and remember all logic for quick fixes.
