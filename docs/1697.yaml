- en: Back to our regular business, we’ve chosen three recent articles as our highlights
    this week, focused on cutting-edge tools and approaches from the ever-exciting
    fields of computer vision and object detection. As multimodal models grow their
    footprint and use cases like autonomous driving, healthcare, and agriculture go
    mainstream, it’s never been more crucial for data and ML practitioners to stay
    up-to-speed with the latest developments. (If you’re more interested in other
    topics at the moment, we’ve got you covered! Scroll down for a handful of carefully
    picked recommendations on neuroscience, music and AI, environmentally conscious
    ML workflows, and more.)

    it, and uses the fun example of counting moving ants on a tree to make her case.'
