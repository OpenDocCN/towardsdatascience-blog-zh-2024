- en: Learning and practicing data science can be challenging — trust me, I have been
    doing it for over four years! I have dealt with all the complicated math equations
    and complex code. However, I now know how to handle it better using techniques
    and advice I picked up along the way, which I will share with you in this article.

    one of the most exciting areas of machine learning.

    to explain how machine learning algorithms work. This math “technically” explains
    what is happening in a very theoretical way but is far from intuitive.
