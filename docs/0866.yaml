    being into video games didn’t make you a cool streamer or e-sport player; it made
    you a nerd.

    to define weightlifting as a sport for nerds: **it is an optimization problem
    where you have to balance training and diet, and you can see your progress in
    numbers**; if you lift more this week than last week, you are getting better.'

    and losing interest got in the way. But a month ago, I got inspired to set up
    a gym at home: a rack, dumbbells, a barbell, weights, and a bench. And just like
    that, I was back in action.'

    thought they were too expensive and didn’t see how they could help more than I
    could help myself. That was a mistake. Training alone led to injuries and I stopped
    getting better, staying just average. Over time, **I learned that having a good
    coach is really important** (in life, in general, in any field).
