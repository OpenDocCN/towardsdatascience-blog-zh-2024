    many years now, and with each passing year, my expertise and comfort level with
    the language gradually grows. Among all the techniques and tricks that I’ve learned
    to write better code over the years, the property decorator stands out as the
    most remarkable one. It has consistently helped me tackle complex problems and
    write clean, efficient, and elegant code.'

- en: The `@property` decorator is an incredibly powerful feature that enhances the
    way you can interact with your class attributes. It can be a powerful way to *intertwine
    attributes* and create dependencies among them. In this beginner-friendly guide,
    we'll explore the underlying concept of properties and dive into 5 different ways
    you can use them to supercharge your classes. We'll also walk through some practical
    examples in data science and machine learning to solidify your understanding.

    enthusiast for the first time and see sparkles in their eyes. If this is your
    first time learning about them, I hope you get sparkles in your eyes too! If you’re
    already a seasoned developer and familiar with the concept, I hope you still find
    something new in…'
