    personally. I decided to take a break from my corporate career to explore a new
    career as an executive and leadership coach in February, but over the last few
    months, I felt something was missing. Then I realized I hadn‚Äôt performed my ritual
    to jot down the journey, successes, and learnings from my role as Product Manager
    for the last 4 years before I moved on to the next thing.

    time I make a big change ‚Äî capturing my raw and honest brain dump of what I learned
    from nine years of working with data, ML, and AI and building products on a global
    scale, why I chose what I chose to do all these years, and an opinion on identities
    and self-worth.

    and capacities across continents. I went on to build more Data, ML, and AI products
    from 2021 to 2024\. I don‚Äôt seem to get enough of it. Why? Because I never seemed
    to get bored of the variety of problems I got to solve, **I always had something
    to learn, and the concepts could be applied across industries to solve many high-impact
    problems ‚Äî the versatility and possibilities were really addictive:**

    as the only Data Scientist on the team. I got to build ML-based fraud prevention,
    booking prediction, automated bidding, personalization, and even NLP products.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Coming from a highly technical background, I was always curious to learn the
    non-technical and business sides of things‚Äîas if to add the remaining half to
    me to be complete. I picked up some topics while working at the startup, and then,
    as a data scientist, I was placed in a marketing function that was obviously closer
    to the business than the product. Looking back, I am grateful for that placement
    because I started to appreciate how critical non-technical functions are to ensure
    a business‚Äôs success.

    and found Product Management to be a good fit, satisfying most of my criteria.
    One of my managers poured so much heart and energy into my transition back then
    that I don‚Äôt think I would have been able to make the transition as smoothly and
    quickly as I did without his support! ‚ù§

    roles across the organization, that I am really good at bringing structure to
    chaos, aligning cross-functional stakeholders, building long-term product visions,
    strategy, and roadmaps, and most interestingly, picking up things/projects no

    problems A LOT MORE than the frontend/UX side of product management, that software
    engineering development is SO different from data science/ML development, that
    DATA WINS over politics, that I love working in collaborative environments more

    has to be centered around people ‚Äî not the business, not the product, but those
    who make it real, daily. Sure, the product and business would be there to bring
    problem statements to collaborate on, but as long as there‚Äôs collaboration with
    amazing people ‚Äî I found myself happy and having fun at work!

    shutting it down‚Äîit was time for me to take a break from the corporate job, have

    things haven‚Äôt settled down in this space, given that I don‚Äôt particularly enjoy
