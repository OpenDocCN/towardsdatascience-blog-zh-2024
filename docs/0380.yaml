- en: As machine learning practitioners, we usually have a dataset (*X*, *y*), and
    we want to find a function *M*— also known as a model — such that *M*(*X*) ≈ *y*.
    Typically, we do not care about the **functional form** of *M***.** As far as
    we are concerned,our model can be a neural network, a tree-based algorithm, or
    something completely different — as long as the performance on the test set is
    good, we are happy.

    patterns, maybe even **fundamental physics or economic laws** within our data.
    In order to do better, I will show you how to build models using **symbolic regression**.These
    models have the property that they consist of only a few terms and can be (re-)implemented
    easily wherever you want. Let us see what I mean by that.

    long it takes for an object to reach the ground when we drop it from some height
    *h*. For example, if you drop an object (*that is heavy enough not to be influenced
    by air resistance*) from a height of *h* = 1.5 m, it will take about *t* = 0.55
    s until it reaches the ground. Try it out!
