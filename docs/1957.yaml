- en: Document parsing is the process of analyzing a document’s content (unstructured
    or semi-structured) to extract specific information or to transform the content
    into a more structured format. The goal of document parsing is to break down the
    document into its constituent parts and interpret these parts. Document parsing
    is very useful for organizations that deal with large volumes of data in various
    formats which requires automated data extraction. There could be several use cases
    where document parsing is useful in business, e.g., invoice processing, analysis
    of legal contracts, customer feedback analysis from multiple sources, and financial
    statement analysis, to name a few.

    using predefined rules such as Regular Expressions (Regex). However, these rules
    lack flexibility and are limited to pre-defined structures. Real-world documents
    often have inconsistencies and do not follow a fixed structure or format. This
    is where LLMs could be of immense potential to extract specific information from
    semi-structured or unstructured documents for further analysis.
