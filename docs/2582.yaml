    to more complex architectures and methodologies. However, in this process we lost
    sight of something important. It is better to have more quality data than better
    models.

- en: Unfortunately, the development of EO datasets has been messy. Nowadays, there
    are hundreds of them. Despite several efforts to compile datasets, it is fair
    to say that they are scattered all over. Additionally, EO data have proliferated
    to serve very specific needs. Paradoxically, this is the opposite way we should
    be moving forward with them, especially if we want our deep learning models to
    work better.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For instance, [ImageNet](https://www.image-net.org/) compiled thousands of images
    to better train computer vision models. Yet, EO data is more complex than the
    ImageNet images database. Unfortunately, there has not been a similar initiative
    for EO purposes. This forces the EO community to try to adapt the ImageNet resource
    to our needs. This process is time-consuming and prone to errors.

    North America and Europe. This is a problem since climate change will affect developing
    countries more.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are several types of image data relevant to climate change. For example,
    aerial photographs, drone footage, and environmental monitoring camera feeds.
    But, remote sensing data (eg. satellite images) offers several advantages. Before
    describing them let’s describe what remote sensing is.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Remote sensors collect information about objects. But, they are not in physical
    contact with them. Remote sensing works based on the physical principle of reflectance.
    Sensors capture the ratio of the light reflected by a surface to the amount of
    light incident to it. Reflectance can provide information about the properties
    of surfaces. For example, it helps us discriminate vegetation, soil, water, and
    urban areas from an image. Different materials have different spectral reflectance
    properties. Meaning they reflect light at different wavelengths. By analyzing
    the reflectances across various wavelengths we can infer not only the composition
    of the Earth’s surface. We can also detect environmental changes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Besides reflectance, there are other remote sensing concepts that we should
    understand.
  prefs: []

- en: '**Spatial resolution:** is the size of the smallest observable object in a
    scene. In other words, we will not be able to see entities smaller than the resolution
    of the image. For example, let’s imagine that we have a satellite image of a city
    with a resolution of 1 Km. This means that each pixel in the image represents
    an area of 1 Km by 1 Km of the urban area. If there is a park in the scene smaller
    than this area, we will not see it. At least not in a clear manner. But we will
    be able to see roads and big buildings.'

- en: '**Spectral resolution:** refers to the number of wavebands a sensor is measuring.
    The wavebands relate to all possible frequencies of electromagnetic radiation.
    There are three main types of spectral resolution. Panchromatic data captures
    wavebands in the visible range. It is also called optical data. Multispectral
    data compile several wavebands at the same time. Color composites use these data.
    Hyperspectral data have hundreds of wavebands. This resolution allows much more
    spectral detail in the image.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Temporal resolution:** is also referred to as the revisit cycle. It is the
    time it takes a satellite to return to its initial position to collect data.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now that we know the basics about remote sensing, let’s discuss its advantages
    for researching climate change. Remote sensing data allows us to cover large areas.
    Also, satellite images often provide continuous data over time. Equally important,
    sensors can capture diverse wavelengths. This enables us to analyze the environment
    beyond our human vision capabilities. Finally, the most important reason is accessibility.
    Remote sensing data is often public. This means that is a cost-effective source
    of information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a next step, we will learn where to find remote sensing data. Here we have
    to make a distinction. Some data platforms provide satellite images. And there
    are computing platforms that allow us to process data and that often also have
    data catalogs. We will explore data platforms first.

    knowledge, the most useful geospatial data platforms. The table privileges open-source
    data. It also includes a couple of commercial platforms as well. These commercial
    datasets can be expensive but worth knowing. They can provide high spatial resolution
    (ranging from 31 to 72 cm) for many applications.

    something. The size and volume of geospatial data is growing. And everything indicates
    that this trend will continue in the future. Thus, it will be improbable that
    we continue to download images from platforms. This approach to processing data
    demands local computing resources. Most likely, we will pre-process and analyze
    data in cloud computing platforms.

    interact with. The main APIs run in two programming languages: JavaScript and
    Python. The original API uses JavaScript. Since I am more of a Pythonista, this
    was intimidating for me at the beginning. Although the actual knowledge of JavaScript
    that you must have is minimal. It is more important to master the GEE built-in
    functions which are very intuitive. The development of the Python API came later.
    Here is where we can unleash the full power of the GEE platform. This API allows
    us to take advantage of Python’s machine-learning libraries. The platform also
    allows us to develop web apps to deploy our geospatial analyses. Although the
    web app functionalities are pretty basic. As a data scientist, I am more comfortable
    using Streamlit to build and deploy my web apps. At least for minimal viable products.'

    data sources. These sources include open data and those from commercial third-party
    providers. Additionally, AWS can integrate our own satellite imagery or mapping
    data. Moreover, the platform facilitates collaboration. It enables us to share
    our data with our team. Furthermore, AWS’s robust computing capabilities empower
    us to efficiently process large-scale geospatial datasets. The processing occurs
    within a standardized environment, supported by available open-source libraries.
    Equally important, it accelerates model building through the provision of pre-trained
    machine-learning models. Also, within the AWS environment, we can generate high-quality
    labels. We can also deploy our models or containers to start predictions. Furthermore,
    AWS facilitates the exploration of predictions through its comprehensive visualization
    tools.

    geospatial datasets with varied spatial and temporal resolutions. Additionally,
    it offers an advantage over GEE and AWS as it does not require coding. We can
    perform our analyses and visualizations on the platform and download the results.
    The range of analyses is somewhat limited, as one might expect, since it does
    not require coding. However, it can be enough for many studies or at least for
    quick preliminary analyses.

    a Jupyter Notebook on your local computer, you are going to love Colab. As with
    Jupyter Notebooks, it allows us to perform analyses with Python interactively.
    Yet, Colab does the same thing in the cloud. I identify three main advantages
    to using Google Colab for our geospatial analyses. First, Colab provides Graphical
    Computing Units (GPUs) capabilities. GPUs are efficient in handling graphics-related
    tasks. Additionally, Colab provides current versions of data science libraries
    (e.g. scikit-learn, Tensorflow, etc.). Finally, it allows us to connect to GEE.
    Thus, we can take advantage of GEE computing resources and data catalog.

    is that it provides satellite image datasets.

    There is a plethora of datasets developed for very specific purposes. Since the
    size and volume of these datasets have increased, it does not make sense to try
    to run our models locally. Nowadays we have fantastic cloud computing resources.
    These platforms even provide some free capabilities to get started.

- en: As a gentle reminder, it is important to mention that the best we can do to
    improve our modeling is to use better data. As users of these data, we can contribute
    to pinpointing the gaps in this arena. It is worth highlighting two of them. First,
    the a lack of a general-purpose benchmark dataset designed for EO observations.
    Another one is the absence of more spatial coverage in developing countries.
