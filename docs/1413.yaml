    part: the powerful hack, a new magical tool, a few lines of code that make everything
    click into place. In reality, a lot has to happen for these final touches to work—from
    developing a solid understanding of what the problem actually is, to sketching
    out a workable process that ensures we find consistent success rather than just
    a temporary band-aid.'

    effective solutions to occasionally thorny challenges. They offer a glimpse into
    practitioners’ mindset as they explore their available resources (data, tools,
    and time, to name a few) and weigh the pros and cons of different workflows. We
    think they might just inspire you to view whatever project you’re working on at
    the moment from a new perspective. Enjoy your reading!
