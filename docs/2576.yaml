- en: Imagine you’re at a table playing a board game. Every decision you make impacts
    not just your outcome, but also that of your opponents. Each move requires careful
    thought as you weigh your options against your rival’s potential responses. This
    back-and-forth creates a challenging situation where planning and strategy are
    crucial. This is the essence of Game Theory. Here, the term “Game” is a metaphor
    for real-life scenarios such as business negotiations, geopolitical treaties,
    and social interactions.

- en: This fascinating field examines how individuals and organizations make decisions
    in situations where their choices dictate the outcome of a game. Game Theory provides
    valuable insights into the decision-making dynamics when the players (or stakeholders)
    behave rationally. It helps us understand how cooperation, non-cooperation, conflict,
    and competition between players participating in a game shape our world.
