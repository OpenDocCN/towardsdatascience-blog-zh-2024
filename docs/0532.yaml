- en: Currently, building applications using large language models (LLMs) can be not
    only complex but also fragile. Typical pipelines are often implemented using prompts,
    which are hand-crafted through trial and error because [LLMs are sensitive to
    how they are prompted](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-2-1-prompting). Thus,
    when you change a piece in your pipeline, such as the LLM or your data, you will
    likely weaken its performance — unless you adapt the prompt (or fine-tuning steps).

- en: '[DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy) [1] is a framework that aims to
    solve the fragility problem in language model (LM)-based applications by prioritizing
    programming over prompting. It allows you to recompile the entire pipeline to
    optimize it to your specific task — instead of repeating manual rounds of prompt
    engineering — whenever you change a component.'
