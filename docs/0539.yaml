    *The Grammar of Graphics*[1], in which he explained the notion that charts could
    be built from building blocks that were analogous to the grammar of a written
    language.

    (and where he became Chief Scientist), ‚ÄúThe Grammar of Graphics provided a new
    way of creating and describing data visualizations, a language ‚Äî or grammar ‚Äî
    for specifying visual elements on a plot, which was a completely novel idea that
    has fundamentally shaped modern data visualization.‚Äù

    the idea, *ggplot2*, the R language charting library which was developed by the
    New Zealand academic, and current Chief Scientist at RStudio, [Hadley Wickham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadley_Wickham).
    He explained ggplot2 in his paper [A Layered Grammar of Graphics](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf)
    and his book *ggplot2*[2]. *ggplot2* has become one of the most popular R packages.
