- en: Most artificial intelligence(AI) models today, including convolution neural
    networks (CNN) and large language models (LLM), are built for specific tasks and
    require humans’ curation of vast training data. They lack the capability to interact
    with the world or to learn continuously. However, deep reinforcement learning
    (RL) stands out as one shining exception, showing scalable self-learning without
    supervision. An RL model has an agent that learns from its interactions with the
    environment to maximize rewards, the behavior mimicking what animals do in natural
    environments. This intersection between engineering and psychology also makes
    RL an ideal model for discovering the brain’s underpinnings of reward-based learning
    and decision-making.

- en: RL was born in the 1950s and has undergone significant enhancements ever since.
    Notably, American mathematician Richard Bellman first established the theoretical
    foundation with Bellman equations and the dynamic programming algorithm (DP).
    In the 1980s, Canadian computer scientist Richard Sutton and his PhD adviser Andrew
    Barto introduced temporal difference learning (TD), which scaled up the learning
    process tremendously. In the 2010s, British computer scientist David Silver and
    his team in DeepMind…
