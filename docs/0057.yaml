    you — but hear me out! I have managed multiple junior data scientists over the
    years and in the last few years I have been teaching an applied Data Science course
    to Masters and PhD students. Most of them have great technical skills but when
    it comes to applying Machine Learning to real-world business problems, I realized
    there were some gaps.

    to [grow their career](/elevate-your-data-science-career-how-to-become-a-senior-data-scientist-5d7546d060e2)!

    deploying machine learning models to predict customer behavior. It’s worth noting
    that the insights can be applicable to scenarios involving product or sensor behaviors
    as well.
