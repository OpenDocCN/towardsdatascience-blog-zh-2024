At the end of May 2020, OpenAI released GPT3, demonstrating the capability of generating good-quality text with a few gentle prompts. It was the first time we could see an AI technique ‘writing something about itself,’ as <a class="af po" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/08/robot-wrote-this-article-gpt-3" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">this article reported</a>. However, this was only accessible and ‘usable’ by those with a relatively strong technical background. In the summer of 2022, OpenAI released the beta version of its text-to-image generator DALL-E. Long story short: AI was getting better and more accessible month after month.

While it fits most use cases, it triggers a negative connotation in education. [This is the same for art, which deserves another article.] As educators, we do not wish/want our students to generate answers for the tasks we give them and hand them in for grading. That is why there is usually an adverse first reaction to AI in the learning process.</p><p id="ada2" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn fq mo b go mp mq mr gr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh fj bk">But that’s only until we explore how this powerful technology can positively transform learning experiences—those of students and educators alike.

This means that every output differs from the one before, even if the same prompt is used to create it. If I copy someone else’s work and submit it as my own, what I copy is comparable and detected as plagiarism. Using Generative AI to create your work is a different form of misconduct. Because it is probabilistic, it follows detecting it is also probabilistic.</p><p id="1687" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn fq mo b go mp mq mr gr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh fj bk">For this reason, I am against using any tool that claims to detect AI-generated content in an educational setting. While it can indicate whether someone used AI to generate work, the lack of certainty makes me uncomfortable taking action on a student, which might impact their career, when I know the possibility of the detection being a false positive.</p><figure class="np nq nr ns nt nu nm nn paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="nv nw ed nx bh ny"><div class="nm nn no"><img src="../Images/f09fb2cb55f5b8871848bea0383331b0.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*5obNrE5NTVegGRM-MVONIw.png"/></div></div><figcaption class="oa ob oc nm nn od oe bf b bg z dx">Would you decide the fate of your students by flipping a coin?

In January 2023 (less than a month after releasing ChatGPT), they launched an AI text classifier which claimed to predict whether a body of text is or is not AI-generated. Guess what happened? They shut it down by July 2023 because it was “<a class="af po" href="https://openai.com/blog/new-ai-classifier-for-indicating-ai-written-text" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">impossible to make this prediction</a>”.

I believe that accountability tops the list because anything else follows. Based on this reasoning, I decided to develop the idea of a Generative AI Journal for my students to complete when they’re working on assignments I give. This journal explains how they used generative AI and how it went. In return, they get marks (in the region of 10%).</p><p id="cd0d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mm mn fq mo b go mp mq mr gr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh fj bk">The key reasoning is the following. I am fine with my employees using AI to be more productive, but I need to know how they use it. This will help me be a better mentor and evaluate the task. Students are tomorrow’s employees. They will work in an environment where AI is available and ready for use. They will be expected to be as productive as possible. The aggregate of all these thoughts is that generative AI should be used accountable and transparently. Based on this reasoning, I came up with the idea of this journal.
