    world, clinging to it is like trying to run a Formula 1 race in a broken-down

    tasks ranging from simple data extraction in investment banking to fairly complex
    insurance pricing models.

    like the UK’s COVID-19 data mishap, where thousands of test results were missed
    due to Excel’s constraints.'

    of complexity onwards.
