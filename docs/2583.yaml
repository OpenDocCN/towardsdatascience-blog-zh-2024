- en: If you are interested in making forecasts about a future outcome, time series
    is the tool for it. Time series data is a collection of observations recorded
    at specific intervals, such as an hourly weather report, or a daily inventory
    and sales report. Time series provide us with tools to understand historical data
    and use them to forecast the future with more certainty. For example, I am personally
    grateful to all those scientists who created the weather forecast app through
    the study of time series and businesses such as Amazon that rely on their sales
    forecast to better place inventory so that I can receive my Amazon order as soon
    as possible!
