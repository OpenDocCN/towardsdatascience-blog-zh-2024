- en: The recent surge in use of LLMs has opened up many possibilities for improving
    our efficiency and productivity. One particularly exciting application has been
    the democratisation of data analytics through Text-to-SQL applications built on
    top of LLMs. In the past few months, weâ€™ve seen many tools emerged to allow developers
    to leverage LLMs for this purpose, such as the [LangChain SQL Agent Toolkit](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/toolkits/sql_database)
    and the more recent [Vanna AI](https://vanna.ai/).

    looking to be more *data-driven* in their decision making. But the ease of abstraction
    provided by these tools brings a critical concern of security. When you use these
    modules to build your applications, you lose visibility of whether your database
    is genuinely secure, or if you have precise control over the queries that are
    being executed. And this is particularly troubling given the vulnerability to
    prompt injections.
