    with was the use of the grouping sets, cube, and rollup functionality that modern
    SQL database systems introduced a number of years ago.

- en: Part of the reason for that was probably because of the type of databases I
    was working with and querying. They were mostly OLTP database systems and I just
    didn’t ever seem to need to use those operators in my day-to-day work.

    around them confusing, so I eventually put them to one side on the metaphorical

    it when the systems I work with introduce functionality that I don’t fully understand

    part of SQL. I embraced ***them*** straight away, used them — a lot — , became
    reasonably proficient in them and was able to do things with them that would have
    been very difficult if not impossible with regular SQL.
