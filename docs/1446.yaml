- en: You always hear that computers are number crunchers. That they process data
    at rates much faster than humans could ever hope to achieve and can make 1000s
    of logical decisions a second. But how do they physically do that? What is so
    special about these very expensive boxes of rocks that they can (in some ways)
    out-think their creators? That’s the question we will aim to address in this article.

- en: This is the second installment in my new series, *A Budding Data Scientist’s
    Introduction to Computer Hardware.* Without assuming any physics, electrical engineering,
    or low-level computer science background, this series seeks to provide an introduction
    to computer hardware to the new (or experienced) data scientist looking to deepen
    their understanding of the tools of the trade. After all, what good workman doesn’t
    want to be familiar with their tools?

    you can go read it here if you want: [Why do Computers even use Binary?](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/why-do-computers-even-use-binary-27e6d99f691d)).
    If you are curious about how computers work, but don’t have much of a background
    in the area, then this series will be a good place for you to start.'
