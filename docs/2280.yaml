- en: Principal Component Analysis or PCA is one of the most popular dimensionality
    reduction methodologies available to statisticians and machine learning practitioners.
    Before diving deeper into what this means, let’s talk about a few scenarios where
    we use such methodologies in our daily life, probably without even knowing.

    to a question, instead of matching our search queries word by word, they use methodologies
    to first reduce the complexity of our searches into smaller parts and then search
    for it — reducing the complexity results in faster results and is done through
    dimensionality reduction.'

    a picture to a website only to find out that the picture exceeded the maximum
    file size? After dealing with the resulting frustration, we then seek help from
    tools such as Photoshop to reduce the size of that image. What Photoshop or similar
    tools perform under the hood is called dimensionality reduction.'
