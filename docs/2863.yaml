    somehow. At the same time, I thought for a long time: if youâ€™re not great at maths,
    you canâ€™t go into computer science, data analysis, data science or IT. After a
    few detours via psychology, I finally ended up in a Salesforce consultant role
    and successfully completed my degree in business informatics and AI, specializing
    in software architecture and design, with top marks.'

    analyzing data, I come across mathematical concepts all the time. When using data
    analysis, automation or Python programming, I donâ€™t think itâ€™s important to understand
    maths topics in every detail. But mathematical understanding does come up very
    often. A few months ago, I wanted to brush up on my understanding of maths and
    logic and came across the app â€˜[Brilliant](https://brilliant.org/)â€™ (no affiliate
    link). The app explains topics such as probability and regression models in a
    super simple way. The cool thing about it is that the app is structured similarly
    to Duolingo and is almost somewhat addictive thanks to the gamification... Read
