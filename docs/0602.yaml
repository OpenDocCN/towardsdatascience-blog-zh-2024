- en: As we’ve explored in previous articles, Large Language Models (LLMs) contain
    a vast amount of knowledge and are able to answer questions across many domains
    just from the data that they have already been fine-tuned on. In the past we’ve
    analyzed how we can utilize techniques such as [Retrieval Augmented Generation
    (RAG)](/augmenting-llms-with-rag-f79de914e672) to enhance responses by providing
    access to additional data that can help a model generate more accurate outputs.
    While RAG and [Fine-Tuning](/an-introduction-to-fine-tuning-pre-trained-transformers-models-9ea546611664)
    can be used to familiarize a model with a specific data/knowledge base, sometimes
    models need access to data sources that are subject to change.

    the weather today, it would be unable to generate a proper response.

    sources. There’s a certain timeframe on which the model was trained and thus might
    not have access to the latest and greatest information that we need to provide
    a proper answer.
