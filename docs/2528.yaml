    Scientific Publications in NIH-Funded Heart Disease Research”, I have used different
    types of pie charts to illustrate some of the key findings from the database analysis.

- en: A pie chart can be an effective choice for data visualization when a dataset
    contains a limited number of categories representing parts of a whole, making
    it well-suited for displaying categorical data with an emphasis on comparing the
    relative proportions of each category.

- en: In this article, I will demonstrate how to create four different types of pie
    charts using the same dataset to provide a more comprehensive visual representation
    and deeper insight into the data. To achieve this, I will use Matplotlib, Python’s
    plotting library, to display pie chart visualizations of the statistical data
    stored in the dataframe. If you are not familiar with Matplotlib library, a good
    start is Python Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas, specifically chapter
    on [Visualization with Matplotlib](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-data-science/9781491912126/ch04.html)
    and [matplotlib.org](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.pie.html).

    disease research publications from 2002 to 2020 and is part of a larger database
    collected for the Master’s Thesis research. The columns “Female,” “Male,” and
    “Unknown” represent the gender of the first author of the published articles,
    while the “Total” column reflects the total number of heart disease research articles
    published in each journal.

    can effectively highlight a key category by pulling it out slightly from the rest
    of the chart. This visual effect draws attention to specific categories, making
    them stand out from the whole. Each slice represents a portion of the total, with
    its size proportional to the data it represents. Labels can be added to each slice
    to indicate the category, along with percentages to show their proportion to the
    total. This visual technique makes the exploded slice stand out without losing
    the context of the full data representation.

    sample dataset, and the resulting charts can be displayed within a single figure.
    This type of visualization helps to highlight the over representation or under
    representation of a particular category within the dataset. In the example provided,
    presenting all 10 charts in one figure reveals that none of the top 10 journals
    in heart disease research published more articles authored by women than men,
    thereby emphasizing the gender disparity.

    data. Donut charts, like pie charts, display the proportions of categories that
    make up a whole, but the center of the donut chart can also be utilized to present
    additional data. This format is less cluttered visually and can make it easier
    to compare the relative sizes of slices compared to a standard pie chart. In the
    example used in this article, the donut chart highlights that among the top 10
    journals for heart disease research publications, the American Journal of Physiology,
    Heart and Circulatory Physiology published the most articles, accounting for 21.8%.

    by building on the previous donut chart and creating a nested version. The [add_artist()](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.figure.Figure.add_artist.html)
    method from Matplotlib’s figure module is used to incorporate any additional Artist
    (such as figures or objects) into the base figure. Similar to the earlier donut
    chart, this variation displays the distribution of publications across the top
    10 journals for heart disease research. However, it also includes an additional
    layer that shows the gender distribution of first authors for each journal. This
    visualization highlights that a larger percentage of the first authors are male.

- en: In conclusion, pie charts are effective for visualizing data with a limited
    number of categories, as they enable viewers to quickly understand the most important
    categories or dominant proportions at a glance. In this specific example, the
    use of four different types of pie charts provides a clear visualization of the
    gender distribution among first authors in the top 10 journals for heart disease
    research publications, based on the 2002 to 2020 mini dataset used in this study.
    It is evident that a higher percentage of the publication’s first authors are
    males, and none of the top 10 journals for heart disease research published more
    articles authored by females than by males during the examined period.
