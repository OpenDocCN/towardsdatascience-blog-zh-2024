- en: I have always had a soft spot for words that perfectly capture the essence of
    a concept. During one of my trips to Japan, I discovered the word ***Tsundoku***.
    It refers to the habit of acquiring books and letting them pile up without reading
    them. I immediately fell in love with the word because, like many, I have a habit
    of buying more books than I can read. Some I eventually get to, while others simply
    accumulate.

- en: As founder of [Kindata.io](https://kindata.io) and a consultant for large companies
    on data value, I often encounter usage of data catalogues that make me want to
    scream, “Tsundoku!”. These catalogues, like stacks of unread books, are filled
    with detailed descriptions of data that sits idle, giving a false sense of accomplishment.
    A book not read is knowledge wasted; similarly, data not exploited for business
    value is potential wasted.

    are eager to see their data used to its full potential. They also understand that
    getting there will require a change in mindset. Working in data, they also appreciate
    the power of well-named concepts. I have heard many terms being used for this
    work of alignment to business value, but I must say that I have become fond of
    one that is picking up: ***Data Value Lineage*.** This term resonates deeply with
    me because it perfectly captures what I am championing. It highlights the need
    to turn idle data into actionable insights by making sure that everything that
    you do in the data teams is firmly linked to value creation.'

    all about understanding dependencies, bias, and potential quality issues. It provides
    explainability and helps data engineering teams repair broken pipelines. It is

    it stops when the data is effectively used by an application.

    contributes to business value generation.
