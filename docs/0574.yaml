    pilot (“[Analyzing the Life of (Scanned) Jane](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/emotions-in-the-loop-1a68268a8823)”)
    I imagined an ultimate personal assistant interconnected with various personal
    devices and equipped with multiple emotion recognition systems. The reasons I

    devote some attention to the question of what are emotions in this context. Both
    legally and technically speaking. And as we’ll soon see these two meanings are
    inextricably connected. Now, to not waste too much time and space here, let’s
    dive into it!

    feeling that so change men as to affect their judgements*.”[[1]](#_ftn1) Over
    Charles Darwin and William James, who first connected emotions with their bodily
    manifestations and causes.[[2]](#_ftn2) All the way to technologies, such as those
    used by our lovely, scanned Jane, that collect and interpret those bodily manifestations
    and appear to know us better than we know ourselves as a consequence.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This fascination has driven us towards discovering not just the power of emotions,
    but also ways as to how one can influence them. And that both to make ourselves
    and others feel better, as well as to deceive and manipulate. Now enter artificial
    intelligence, which graciously provided the possibility to both recognize and
    influence emotions at scale. However, despite how deeply fascinated we appear
    to be with emotions and the power they wield over us, our laws still fall short
    of protecting us from malevolent emotional manipulation. One of the reasons why
    this might be the case is because we are still not really sure what emotions are
    in general, let alone legally speaking. So let’s try and see if we can at least
    answer the second question, even if the answer to the first continues to elude
    us.

- en: 2\. Emotions as (Personal) Data?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One thing that may come to mind when thinking about emotions legally, and especially
    in the context of artificial intelligence, is that they are some kind of data.
    Maybe even personal data. After all, what can be more personal than emotions?
    Than your feelings that you so carefully keep to yourself? Well, let’s briefly
    consider this hypothesis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Personal data under the GDPR is defined as “*any information relating to an
    identified or identifiable natural person.*” An identifiable natural person being
    the one who can (at least theoretically) be identified by someone somewhere, regardless
    of whether directly or indirectly. The slightly problematic thing about emotions
    in this context is that they are universal. Sadness, happiness, anger, or excitement
    don’t tell me anything that would make me identify the subject experiencing these
    emotions. But this is an overly simplistic approach.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First of all, emotional data never exists in a vacuum. Quite to the contrary,
    it is inferred by processing large quantities of (sometimes more, sometimes less,
    but always) personal data. It is deduced by analyzing our health data such as
    blood pressure and heart rate, as well as our biometric data like eye movements,
    facial scans, or voice scans. And by combining all these various data points used,
    it is in fact possible to identify a person.[[3]](#_ftn3) Even the GDPR testifies
    to this fact by explaining already in the definition of personal data that indirect
    identification can be achieved by referencing “*one or more factors specific to
    the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity
    of [a] natural person.*”[[4]](#_ftn4)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The easiest examples are, of course, various emotion recognition systems in
    wearable and personal devices such as the ones Jane has, where the data is directly
    connected with her user profile and social media data, making the identification
    that much simpler. However, even when we are not dealing with personal devices,
    it is still possible to indirectly identify people. For instance, a person standing
    in front of a smart billboard and receiving an ad based on their emotional state
    combined with other noticeable characteristics.[[5]](#_ftn5) Why? Well, because
    identification is relative and highly context-specific. For instance, it is not
    the same if I say “I saw a sad-looking girl” or if I say “Look at that sad-looking
    girl across the street”. By narrowing the context and the number of other possible
    individuals I could be referring to identification becomes a very probable possibility,
    even though all I used was very generic information.[[6]](#_ftn6)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Furthermore, whether someone is *identifiable* will also heavily depend on what
    we mean by that word. Namely, we could mean identifying as ‘knowing by name and/or
    other citizen data’. This would, however, be ridiculous as that data is changeable,
    can be faked and manipulated, and not to mention the fact that not all people
    have it. (Think illegal immigrants who [often don’t have access to any form of
    official identification](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/providing-identification-to-unauthorized-immigrants/).)
    Are people without an ID per definition not identifiable? I think not. Or, if
    they are, there is something seriously wrong with how we think about identification.
    This is also becoming a rather common argument for considering data processing
    operations GDPR relevant, with increasingly many authors taking a broad notion
    of identification as ‘individuation’[[7]](#_ftn7), ‘distinction’,[[8]](#_ftn8)
    and even ‘targeting’.[[9]](#_ftn9) All of which are things all of these systems
    were designed to do.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, it would appear that emotions and emotional data might very well be within
    the scope of the GDPR, regardless of whether the company processing it also uses
    it to identify a person. However, even if they aren’t, the data used to infer
    emotions will most certainly always be personal. This in turn makes the GDPR applicable.
    We are not getting into the nitty gritty of what this means or all the ways in
    which the provisions of the GDPR are being infringed by most (all?) providers
    of emotion recognition technologies at this point. They are after all still busy
    arguing that the emotional data isn’t personal in the first place.

- en: 'We’ve all heard the phrase: “You know my name, not my story.” We also all know
    that that is very true. Our names (and other clearly personal data) say much less
    about who we are than our emotions. Our names can also not be used for the same
    intrusive and disempowering purposes, at least not to the extent that recognizing
    our emotional states can be. That is also why we are in most cases not being identified
    by the providers of these systems. They don’t care about what your name is. They
    care about what you care about, what you give your attention to, what excites
    or disturbs you.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sure, some of them sell health devices that then infer your emotions and psychological
    states for health purposes. Just as scanned Jane, many people probably buy them
    exactly for this purpose. However, most (all?) of them are not doing just that.
    Why let all that valuable data go to waste when it can also be used to partner
    up with other commercial entities and serve you ultimately personalized ads? Or
    even save you the trouble and just order the thing for you. After all, the entity
    they partnered up with was just one of the solid options that could have been
    chosen for something that you (presumably) need.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, for these purposes and especially when considering other, non-health-device,
    emotion recognition systems, it is also increasingly irrelevant to recognize specific
    emotions. Making the whole, debate on whether ‘*reading*’ emotions is a science
    or a pseudoscience to a greater extent irrelevant. As well as the previously discussed
    question of what emotions are, because then we have to go through the same mental
    exercise for any state they eventually end up recognizing and using. For instance,
    nowadays it is much more important to put you somewhere on the PAD (pleasure-arousal-dominance)
    scale.[[10]](#_ftn10) This then suffices to asses your general attitude towards
    a particular information, situation, ad, you name it. Is it causing positive or
    negative sensations, is it capturing your attention or not, is it making you proactive
    or receptive? And that is finally enough to serve you with just the right ad at
    just the right time. If you are even still being served an ad that is and not
    just getting a delivery to your door.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, what are emotions? They are a lot of things. They are internal perceptions
    of our current state and environment. External representation of those perceptions.
    And computational readings of those representations. This long-winded road also
    makes them a type of data. Data that can in some cases, when combined with other
    data points or used in narrow enough contexts, be personal. And this holds true,
    irrespectful of what emotions are in a psychological sense. Lest we wish to get
    entangled into questions of what *attention* and *excitement* are. Or have system
    providers sleazing out of the GDPR scope by claiming they don’t actually recognize
    emotions but rather simply track user reactions across the PAD scale.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This conclusion then makes any single entity recognizing and using data obtained
    by ‘*reading*’ our facial expressions and bodily cues also responsible for what
    it does with the collected data. With the bare minimum of its obligations lying
    somewhere between meaningful transparency with full disclosure of purposes for
    which the data is collected and including an easily accessible possibility to
    object to the processing. This is currently far from common practice.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even when it comes to Jane’s all too smart devices, mentioning how the data
    is collected, used to predict her emotional states, and then make decisions based
    on those states somewhere in the Terms of Service does not mean transparency can
    be ticked off the list. And where are we then from having any type of influence
    over these data flows that we constantly emit into our orbit for our devices to
    process?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, when other, non-personal devices are considered, the situation gets
    even worse, of course. Be it mood-based social media algorithms or smart billboards,
    they all process personal data to generate some more (as we have established)
    personal data and use it to influence our behavior. Being fully mindful of the
    fact that it is difficult to fulfill the transparency requirements when individuals
    are walking past a billboard or scrolling social media, they are still requirements.
    Not just helpful recommendations. Envisioning novel approaches for achieving meaningful
    transparency is a MUST. And so is thinking about emotions and emotional data in
    a robust manner, free of psychological finesses and discussions. Otherwise, we
    might soon lose all that is left of our power to make decisions.
