- en: I often get asked about my transition from engineering to data science. Having
    made the leap, I’ve learned what works (and what doesn’t) and I thought it would
    be of value to share my insight to hopefully save you a lot of time.

- en: Engineers have all the tools to be great machine learning practitioners. They
    are problem solvers, and they tend to be practical. They can cut through the noise
    and leverage what already works to build a solution to a problem. Without getting
    bogged down trying to code a new neural network from scratch.
