- en: I can’t believe it has already been 9 months since I have been working as a
    freelance data scientist! I originally wrote about making the leap after I was
    [3 months in](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/what-i-learned-in-my-first-3-months-as-a-freelance-data-scientist-8e3417ff8165).
    Getting started my husband and I agreed that we would try it for 3 months and
    that we would know after 3 months if it was going to work. I am very pleased (and
    fortunate) to say that we knew after about a month that it looked like freelancing
    was going to work for us.

    facing layoffs, return-to-office mandates (which are typically layoffs in disguise),
    and burn out. I also have learned a lot more in the past 6 months about how to
    make this work. I also made some key mistakes and have learned from them on some
    things not to do. So I thought it was time to post an update to the original post.

    first because there are some important things in there that I will not cover here.
    Like last time, I would also like to give a shout out to [Brett Trainor](https://linktr.ee/bretttrainor)
    who has created on online community (it is mostly Gen X-ers, but applicable to
    most people) called The Corporate Escapees dedicated to helping people free themselves
    from corporate work. He also has a great presence on [TikTok.](https://www.tiktok.com/@the_corporate_escapee?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc)
    Brett and the “Escapees” have been great to bounce ideas off of and provide a
    wealth of information on getting started and flourishing while working as a freelancer,
    fractional, consultant, or solopreneur.

- en: In my original post I had laid out several things I love about having gone out
    on my own. These things included stuff like working on what I work on when I want
    to work on it and making my own rules for my company. In the past 6 months I have
    discovered some new ones and learned more about the ones I already knew. So I
    thought I would briefly describe them here.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, I (still) get to work from home. I have been working from home since
    2017, which has given me the freedom to live where I want. I am a mountain creature
    and so the idea of moving to some random city away from all of the outdoor activities
    I love is not at all appealing to me. (In fact, I left the field of my PhD so
    that I could take a remote job…something that was not possible in that field.)
    More importantly, we are seeing many companies that went remote with the pandemic
    issue return to office (RTO) mandates. It is well documented that many of these
    are [layoffs in disguise](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/12/why-rto-mandates-are-layoffs-in-disguise-according-to-workplace-experts.html).
    So in reality, I have more job stability as a freelancer! And those companies
    that are laying off still have work that needs to be done. They just don’t have
    the positions to do it because they have laid people off. This means that freelancing
    is actually going to be more stable over the long run, because these companies
    will need to bring in someone to do the work!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next — and this is no small one — is that I no longer am subjected to the huge
    waste of time that is a performance review. I have watched coworkers turn themselves
    inside out writing their self assessments fretting over every single punctuation
    mark only to have them essentially ignored. I have written many self assessments
    that included jokes and laughable things that managers have never commented on
    or noticed because they never read them! The process of performance reviews is
    broken. And what is the point when the majority of the time “meets expectations”
    lands you a so-called raise that is less than the increase in the cost of living?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is not to say that as a freelancer your performance doesn’t matter. It
    is just that you don’t have to get all anxious and waste your time listening to
    your boss rattle back to you some list of accomplishments, tell you that you are
    doing a good job, and not give you too much reward for it. Instead, the reward
    for a freelancer (or the management of a poorly-performing one) is done through
    repeat business. Does a client choose to renew or extend your contract? Are they
    giving your name out to their friends as a referral? If so, job well done!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One that should not be overlooked is the fact that I have control over how my
    company-of-one runs. This has a lot of different impacts. First, I do not have
    to go ask numerous managers permission to work on a thing. If I want to work on
    something, I work on it. Ideally, there are others who need that type of work
    done that I can help. Second, I determine the finances of the company and don’t
    need to ask permission to attend a conference, take a class, travel to meet with
    a prospective client, or buy a new software tool. While it might sound silly,
    I actually am giddy (in a geeky kind of way) that I get to pick my own computer.
    I greatly dislike being forced to use Windows or Mac (Pop_OS FTW!!!) or being
    tied into a particular type of hardware. If I think it would benefit my business
    by me attending or speaking at a particular conference, I go and don’t need to
    play “Mother May I?” to get permission to go. If I decide I need to buy a particular
    book for my continuing education, I don’t need to ask someone. There is great
    freedom in this! (And, by the way, these things are tax deductible as well!)

- en: What this means is that it is really hard to be a successful freelancer — in
    data science or otherwise — if you have not already been working as a data scientist
    for some period of time. When clients hire freelancers they are trying to solve
    a problem. They want to know that the freelancer they are hiring knows how to
    solve it and has experience in doing so. This means that it is very difficult
    to be a successful data science freelancer as your first job out of school. Even
    graduate school. Real-world experience is highly valued by those who look to hire
    freelancers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The good news is that the act of getting that so-called real-world experience
    is already a key step in developing your network (i.e. the group in the first
    bullet point above). Many freelancers I know have their previous employers as
    some of their first clients. This is also why it is really important to avoid
    burning bridges with those you have worked with in the past, because you never
    know could be your client in the future!

    as ways to grow your network further. I still hold to that. However, it is also
    important to recognize that not everyone does well at conferences. There are some
    neurodivergent people who find conferences to be difficult. And that is OK! There
    are ways to build your network beyond conferences, especially including things
    like blogging here and elsewhere! What you are looking to do, whether at conferences
    or blogging, is to grow your brand and brand awareness. When people think of you
    as a data scientist, what types of things do you want them to think of? Maybe
    you are a whiz at forecasting. Blog about it! Maybe you really enjoy writing code
    to solve a certain type of problem. Create a YouTube video about it!

    that is you. This, of course, means that people need to be able to find your brand
    and learn about it. Particularly if your network is not large, this means that
    people need to be able to see your work. Here is where creating a really awesome

    portfolio. I will just summarize some key points here.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, your portfolio should use an interesting data set. Do not use any data
    set from educational forums such as the Titanic data set, MNIST, cat versus dog
    via imagery, etc. Kaggle, while a great learning tool, does not always reflect
    the real work. You want the data to be as realistic as possible. It should be
    noisy and messy because this is how real-world data is. It should answer an interesting
    question (bonus points if it is an interesting question that could make a company
    money or solve a big problem). And it should also be data on a subject you are
    interested in and knowledgeable about so you can personally identify if the answers
    make sense and talk people through it like a subject matter expert.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, you need to tell a complete story for each project in your portfolio.
    Do not just put up a bunch of code with no explanation for how to use it. Do not
    provide results from some model without an explanation of what is going on with
    the model and the data and what conclusions should be drawn. A good portfolio
    project is as much about the explanations of your work as it is about the code.
    Your explanations should be extensive. You need to demonstrate that you not only
    know how to code, but know how to walk the reader through the full start-to-finish
    story of problem to solution.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your portfolio projects, when possible, should be interactive. You want people
    to be able to see that the code runs. I personally am a big fan of setting up
    an inexpensive virtual machine somewhere and running [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
    dashboards for interactivity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because your portfolio is about brand awareness, think about what your brand
    is. For example, if you are wanting to advertise yourself as being really good
    with recommendation engines, don’t waste time demonstrating solutions in image
    analysis. You are going to be showing your future clients the types of problems
    you can solve for them. The more obvious you make that, the better.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, whenever you make an update to your portfolio, you need to get the
    word out there. Make a blog post or YouTube video to go with it. Make the code
    publicly available on GitHub or GitLab. Post on LinkedIn links to the portfolio
    and point out the new content. Post another link once the blog post is published.

    in some pretty specific domains. However, being a freelancer is about solving
    a problem. Frequently (and especially with startups that don’t have many employees)
    you will be expected to know how to do more than create the small, superb solution
    to the problem. You will need to know how to solve the problem from beginning
    to end. This means that you will need to work beyond that small, niche skill.

    that go beyond my favorite areas of graphs, NLP, LLMs, etc. I have had to learn
    a fair bit more about data engineering, MLOps/LLMOps, and cloud architecture.
    I am paying to take classes and go to conferences on these subjects (see above…my
    management approved it ;) ). These are investments in me, which means they are
    investments in my business. The more I can offer clients, the more clients whose
    problems I can solve. It is important as a freelancer that you be able to offer
    as much as possible!

    while freelancing comes from having a variety of types of clients ranging from
    major clients who are steady and consistent to those who might be profitable after
    some work with them to those who might be long shots. It is worth noting in my
    case that startups, by the very fact that they are startups and especially true
    of early-stage startups, might not necessarily be considered “steady and consistent.”
    If you rely only on them then you need to be prepared for your work to be cancelled
    or your hours cut due to fluctuations in the cash flow and budget. And it is a
    bad idea to compensate for that by taking on a lot of startups (see below on taking
    on too much work). This also means that you need to have a good financial cushion
    such that if hours dry up a bit for a period of time you can still pay your bills.

    as freelancer, I would direct you to the “Mistakes I have made so far section
    below.” Don’t worry, I will cover that topic. But let’s hit a few other insurance
    topics first.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By far, one of the biggest changes in going solo has been the fact that I no
    longer have company-provided benefits. This has a few implications that you need
    to factor in as you are determining your finances for going solo. This section
    might be fairly US-centric since other countries offer different benefits. But
    it is definitely something to educate yourself on, regardless of where you live.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, when you are working for a company it is unlikely that they are going
    to sue you if you do a bad job (with a few exceptions, of course). However, when
    you are working as a solopreneur that is not a guarantee. When I was just getting
    started, I didn’t really think about these things. I just figured that my clients
    and I would have a contract with a solid statement of work, good communication,
    and clear deliverables and that would take care of that. I have not been sued
    (and hope that I never am!), but it is naive to think that it couldn’t happen
    at some point in the future.
  prefs: []

- en: This is what professional liability insurance is for. It covers both businesses
    and individuals for claims that might arise out of allegations of mistakes, missed
    deliveries, or breach of contract. In fact, some larger organizations that you
    might contract with actually *require* that you carry it. So best to plan for
    this in advance. It is really easy to get online and reasonable plans cost less
    than $200/month.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another insurance I had not initially considered was long-term disability insurance.
    Many people have disability insurance, both short- and long-term, as part of their
    corporate benefits package and don’t even think about it. In my specific case,
    I am the sole bread winner for my family for a big portion of the year (my spouse
    works a seasonal job). If something were to happen to me and I couldn’t work,
    this would be a devastating blow to my family, one we could not afford. Therefore,
    getting disability insurance is something you should really think about.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generally speaking “long term” means beyond 3 months. If you sit down and price
    it out, you will find that the price of short-term and long-term is about the
    same. Therefore, we decided not to get short-term disability insurance since it
    is so expensive, which implies that we will make sure that we are financially
    able to cover 3 months of living without an income should something happen to
    me.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another big benefit that corporate employers offer (at least in the United States)
    is that they contribute something to your retirement. Typically, this is in the
    form of a 401k matching contribution. As a freelancer, you can still contribute
    to your retirement, but you need to make the conscious decision to do so since
    you will no longer have an employer automatically deducting it from your paycheck.
    Here is where I strongly recommend you talk with a financial advisor on the best
    ways to save for retirement.

    keeps people tied to corporate work. There is no reasonably-priced way to get
    health insurance when you are working for yourself. Yes, there is the open market
    (AKA Obamacare), so at least that option exists (a brief moment of tribute to
    the freelancers who went out there before Obamacare).
  prefs: []

- en: As I previously said, my spouse works seasonally but is offered health insurance
    during the season. So it made sense that we would go on is health insurance when
    I left corporate. This left us trying to figure out what we would do when the
    season was over. We had the option of COBRA (the ability to keep your health insurance
    through your existing, corporate plan while paying the full monthly premiums)
    or to go on the open market. Because I was having surgery while he was still working,
    we decided to do COBRA since I would be reaching my maximum out-of-pocket (OOP)
    and we could then take advantage of not having to pay anything for the rest of
    the year.

    was expensive, but we completely underestimated. For our family of 3, it came
    out to $3000/month. Yes, really. Yet I now know that I can get comparable packages
    on the open market for half that. It is still not cheap and it is tax deductible
    either way. If I sat down and really calculated out how much we were saving by
    reaching max OOP, it still would have been cheaper to go on the open market. A
    lesson we will not repeat next year.

    In the beginning of the freelancing journey, you worry that you will not make
    enough money, so you take on a ton of work to make sure you do. Later in the journey,
    you will have a contract come to and end (sometimes prematurely) or a client throttle
    back your hours.

    never dip below what I made in my corporate work, I have a tendency to overcompensate
    and take on too many clients or too many hours. I am very fortunate to be in the
    situation where I can do so. Some have suggested taht I bring on additional employees
    into my company so I can accommodate this work load. However, this is a double-edged
    sword. The moment you take on additional employees you are responsible for getting
    them work. If I am constantly nervous one month to the next about whether I will
    meet my income requirements, adding additional employees to that mix is only going
    to make that feeling worse.

- en: One final note on that anxiety has to do with your financial planning. In my
    original article I talked a fair bit about this. However, I would like to add
    that you can help alleviate some of that anxiety by having a good amount of savings
    before going into freelancing. That way, should work be light for a particular
    month you know that you are not going to be immediately in trouble. One bit of
    advice I was given was to be able to support yourself without any paying work
    at all for 6 months. This might sound rather extreme, but having set aside money
    for when the work is light is very, very important.

    have previous stated, I really enjoy working with smaller startups. However, like
    I said before, diversity of clients is also important. Thus, it is a good idea
    to have some larger companies that you are supporting.

- en: This is not without its complexities though. The larger the organization, the
    larger the bureaucracy. What this means for the freelancer is that it takes much
    more time and is much harder to get them under contract. They frequently have
    requirements for things like proof of liability insurance (see above), registration
    as an entity in complicated systems, and even drug and background tests. Sometimes
    they expect that you will pay for those things out of pocket before they can work
    with you.

    Not only will your time assembling these things not be compensated (and, in fact,
    will cost you money since it is taking time away from other paying clients), but
    you might also have to *spend* money in the form of fees for drug and background
    tests, signing up for liability insurance, etc. It is up to you to decide if it
    is worth it. Again, I refer you to the points about diversity of clients.

    When you work in a corporate setting, you can always meet up (in person or virtually)
    with a coworker for a gripe session, to bounce ideas off of, or just for general
    socialization. As a freelancer, you do not have that as easily and it can get
    lonely.

    group of people. First and foremost, without the support of my husband this would
    not have been possible. In fact, I think going solo *without* the support of your
    significant other if you have one is a supremely bad idea. There is nothing certain
    or guaranteed about freelancing and that can be challenging on a family.

    your clients. There are many groups of solopreneurs available online, such as
    The Corporate Escapees I referred to before, who are like-situated individuals.
    Many are not data scientists themselves, but they possess a wealth of information
    on the business side of things. I strongly recommend finding a group that you
    resonate with.

    post I talked about feeling much more secure *not* being in the corporate world.
    That is even more true today. With all of the layoffs in the tech world, I hear
    from friends and former colleagues all the time about how hard of a time they
    are having at finding a new job. This is really, really sad and I truly feel for
    them.

    I can sustain this model long term. I have experienced having my hours throttled
    and clients coming and going, but each time it seems that things have worked out
    since I have other work that comes up to take its place. So that seems very positive
    to me.

    diversity of income streams. Working on an hourly basis as a freelancer is nice,
    but now I am looking to create other types of work, whether through retainers
    or creation of sellable products, that will generate revenue beyond simply billing
    hours. Stay tuned!
