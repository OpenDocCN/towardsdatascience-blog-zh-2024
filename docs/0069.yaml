- en: Deep learning has made huge progress over the last decade, and while early models
    were hard to understand and apply, modern frameworks and tools allow everyone
    with a bit of code understanding to train their own neural network for computer
    vision tasks.

- en: In this article, I will thoroughly demonstrate how to load and augment data
    as well as the bounding boxes, train an object detection algorithm, and eventually
    see how accurately we’re able to detect objects in the test images. While the
    available tool kits have become much easier to use over time, there are still
    a few pitfalls you might run into.

- en: Computer vision is both a very popular and, even more, a broad field of research
    and application. Advances that have been made in deep learning, especially over
    the last decade, tremendously accelerated our understanding of deep learning and
    its broad potential of usage.

- en: Why do we see those advances right now? As Francois Chollet (the father of Keras
    library) describes it, we witnessed an increase of computational capabilities
    in CPUs that rose by a factor of roughly 5000, just…
