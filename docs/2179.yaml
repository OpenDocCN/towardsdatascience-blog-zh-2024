    clarity. But when the chaos is your own family’s nanny schedule, even the best-laid
    plans can go awry. The thought of work meetings, nap times, and unpredictable
    shifts have our minds running in circles — until I realized I could use the same
    algorithms that solve business problems to solve a very personal one. Armed with
    Monte Carlo simulation, genetic algorithms, and a dash of parental ingenuity,
    I embarked on a journey to tame our wild schedules, one algorithmic tweak at a
    time. The results? Well, let’s just say our nanny’s new schedule looks like a
    perfect fit.

    1, with a predictable 9-to-5, was the easy piece of the puzzle. But then came
    Parent 2, whose shifts in a bustling emergency department at a Chicago hospital
    were anything but predictable. Some days started with the crack of dawn, while
    others stretched late into the night, with no rhyme or reason to the pattern.
    Suddenly, what used to be a straightforward schedule turned into a Rubik’s Cube
    with no solution in sight.

    afternoons always being a guessing game, and evenings — who knows? Our family

    system’s behavior. In this case, we’re going to use it to randomly generate possible
    work schedules for Parent 2, allowing us to simulate the unpredictable nature
    of their shifts over many iterations.*

    The beauty of Monte Carlo is that it doesn’t just give you one answer — it gives
    you thousands, each one a different glimpse into the future.'

    could throw at us. Whether it was an early morning shift or a late-night emergency,
    the simulation helped us see all the possibilities, so we could plan for the most
    likely — and the most disastrous — scenarios. Think of it as chaos insurance,
    with the added bonus of a little peace of mind.

    2 over a five-day workweek (Monday-Friday). Each day, there’s a probability that
    Parent 2 is called into work, and if so, a random shift is chosen from a set of
    predefined shifts based on those probabilities. We’ve also added a feature that
    accounts for a standing meeting on Wednesdays at 1pm and adjusts Parent 2’s schedule
    accordingly.

    over a workweek and combine it with Parent 1’s more predictable 9–5 schedule.
    By repeating this process for 52 weeks, we can simulate a typical year and identify
    the gaps in parental coverage. This allows us to plan for when the nanny is needed
    the most. The image below summarizes the parental unavailability across a simulated
    52-week period, helping us visualize where additional childcare support is required.
