- en: R**einforcement learning** is a domain in machine learning that introduces the
    concept of an agent learning optimal strategies in complex environments. The agent
    learns from its actions, which result in rewards, based on the environment’s state.
    Reinforcement learning is a challenging topic and differs significantly from other
    areas of machine learning.

    can be used to enable the agent adapt to completely different, unknown, and complex
    conditions.

- en: In [part 7](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/reinforcement-learning-part-7-introduction-to-value-function-approximation-2e22495f7008),
    we introduced **value-function approximation** algorithms which scale standard
    tabular methods. Apart from that, we particularly focused on a very important
    case when the approximated value function is **linear**. As we found out, the
    linearity provides guaranteed convergence either to the ***global optimum*** or
    to the ***TD fixed point*** (in ***semi-gradient*** methods).

    value function, rather than just a simple scalar product, without leaving the
    linear optimization space. The…
