- en: I took my first steps in mathematical modeling about 9 years ago when I was
    still a student. After finishing my bachelor’s degree in mathematics that was
    very theory heavy, for master studies I chose some courses that involved mathematical
    modeling and optimization of economic issues. My favorite topic at that time was
    time-series. It was relatively relaxed to get an overview of different modeling
    approaches. Proven methods had been in place for over a decade and had not changed
    rapidly.

    data science. The fundamental techniques and models were relatively quick to learn.
    In implementation, a lot was solved *from scratch*, own networks were coded and
    worked. New tools & technologies were welcomed and tried out.

    become extreme. The race is on between open source and closed source. Google followed
    with Gemini, Meta released LLama, and Stanford University introduced Alpaca. Applications
    are operationalized using tools like Langchain, and a whole range of tools for
    standardizing applications are emerging. Tuning mechanisms are continually improved.
    And then there was also the release of xgboost 2.

- en: The last time I attended a big conference, I lay awake for two nights, barely
    able to sleep. It wasn’t just due to the nervousness before a talk, but also because
    of the massive amount of information that was hurled at me in such a short time.
  prefs: []

- en: Conferences are fantastic. I like meeting new people, learning about different
    approaches, and exchanging ideas and problems that might be completely new to
    me. Yet, I found no sleep those nights. The *I’ll need to check this later in
    more depth*-list seems impossible to tackle. FOMO (fear of missing out) kicks
    in. Thoughts occur like “*isn’t it already too late to jump on the train for GenAI?*”
    At that moment, I overlooked the fact that I was part of the bias, too. My presentation
    was about a use case we implemented with a client. Two years of work compressed
    into thirty minutes. Did the audience take away valuable impulses and food for
    thought as intended? Or did the contribution also subtly cause FOMO?

    describes the emerge of strong doubts about one’s own abilities, coupled with
    the fear of being exposed as a “fraud.” People who suffer from imposter syndrome
    often feel as though they are not capable or qualified for the positions or tasks
    they hold. This can also arise through comparisons with others, leading to a momentary
    self-perception: “*I can’t actually do anything good.*”'

- en: What is the core element of data science? It’s about a functioning system that
    creates added value. If you’re not a researcher but a data scientist in business,
    the focus is on application. A model or heuristic learns a logic that a human
    being cannot learn in such detail and/or apply on such a scale. It doesn’t have
    to be an end-to-end, fully automated solution.

    by the stakeholders. Once trust in the system is established, one can look at
    what can be further improved.

    new technologies also increases with the amount of experience one has already
    gained. The same applies to the ability to assess technologies and tools. The
    greater one’s own wealth of experience, the easier it becomes. But this requires
    having first developed a deeper understanding of other technologies, which can
    only be achieved through hands-on experience.

    asked for feedback and suggestions for improvement. A discussion was also initiated

    between AI **engineering** and data **science**.
