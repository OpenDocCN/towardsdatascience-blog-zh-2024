    versions likely will, it might be more strategic to wait or to develop a less

    to overwork and fix current LLMs limitations. Again, Data Scientists and AI experts
    can help **introduce the sensibility on the direction of all this progress**,
    and differentiate which things are likely to be tackled from the model provider
    side, to the things that should be tackled internally. For instance, incorporating
    features that allow users to edit or supervise the output of an LLM can be more
    effective than aiming for full automation with complex logic or fine-tunings.

    appropriate Large Language Model (LLM), prompt engineering or prompt iteration,
    offline evaluation, and use an API to integrate the model into production. This
    reduces greatly the time from idea to deployment, often taking just **weeks instead
    of months**. Moreover, much of the maintenance burden is managed by the LLM provider,
    further decreasing operational costs and complexity.

    without the need to collect labelled data or invest in training and deploying
    in-house models. Once value is proven, ML teams might decide it makes sense to
    transition to traditional ML solutions to decrease costs or latency, while potentially
    leveraging labelled data from the initial GenAI system. Similarly, many companies
    are now moving to Small Language Models (SMLs) once value is proven, as they can
    be fine-tuned and more easily deployed while achieving comparable or superior
    performances compared to LLMs ([Small is the new big: The rise of small language

    where they explain how traditional ML models are used alongside LLMs to refine
    classification tasks, such as tagging product brands. An LLM is used when the
    traditional ML model isn’t able to confidently classify something, and if the
    LLM is able to do so, the traditional ML model is retrained with the new annotations
    (great feedback loop!).

- en: Just as with traditional ML, the success of **GenAI relies on robust evaluation**.
    These solutions need to be assessed from multiple perspectives due to their general
    “free output” relationship (answer relevancy, correctness, tone, hallucinations,
    risk of harm…). It is important to run this step before deployment (see picture
    ML vs GenAI project phases above), usually referred to as “offline evaluation”,
    as it allows one to have an idea of the behavior and performance of the system
    when it will be deployed. Make sure to check this [**great overview of LLM evaluation
    metrics**](https://confident-ai.com/blog/llm-evaluation-metrics-everything-you-need-for-llm-evaluation),
    which differentiates between statistical scorers (quantitative metrics like BLEU
    or ROUGE for text relevance) and model-based scorers (e.g., embedding-based similarity
    measures). **DS teams excel in designing and evaluating metrics,** even when these
    metrics can be kind of abstract (e.g. how do you measure usefulness or relevancy?).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once a GenAI solution is deployed, **monitoring becomes critical to ensure that
    it works as intended** and as expected over time. Similar metrics to the ones
    mentioned for evaluation can be checked in order to ensure that the conclusions
    from the offline evaluation are maintained once the solution is deployed and working
    with real data. Monitoring tools like Datadog are already offering [LLM-specific
    observability metrics](https://www.datadoghq.com/product/llm-observability/).
    In this context, it can also be interesting to enrich the quantitative insights
    with qualitative feedback, by working close to User Research teams that can help
    by asking users directly for feedback (e.g. “*do you find these suggestions useful,
    and if not, why?”*).

    running risk assessments, choosing less biased foundational models ([ComplAI](https://compl-ai.org/)
