Or when to upgrade or replace your smartphone ? What best route to take when considering traffic, road closure, time of the day? or How long until your car needs servicing? These are all regular (but not trivial) questions we face (some of them) in our daily life without thinking too much (or nothing at all) of the thought process we go through on the different factors that influence our next course of action. Surely (or maybe after reading these lines) one would be interested to know what factor or factors could have the greatest influence on the expected time until a given event (from the above or any other for that matter) occurs? In statistics, this is referred as time-to-event-analysis or Survival analysis. And this is the focus of this study.</p><p id="9c14" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">In Survival Analysis one aims to analyze the time until an event occurs. In this article, I will be employing survival analysis to predict when a registered member is likely to leave (churn), specifically the number of days until a member cancels his/her membership contract. As the variable of interest is t<em class="oh">he number of days,</em> one key element to explicitly reinforce at this point: the time to event dependent variable is of a continuous type, a variable that can take any value within a certain range. For this, survival analysis is the one to employ.</p><p id="0d64" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">DATA</p><p id="6f0b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">This study was conducted using a proprietary dataset provided by a private organization in the tutoring industry. The data includes anonymized records for confidentiality purposes collected over a period of 2 years, namely July 2022 to October 2024. All analyses were conducted in compliance with ethical standards, ensuring data privacy and anonymity. Therefore, to respect the confidentiality of the data provider, any specific organizational details and/or unique identifier details have been omitted.</p><p id="8973" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">The final dataset after data pre-processing (i.e. tackling nulls, normalizing to handle outliers, aggregating to remove duplicates and grouping to a sensible level) contains a total of 44,197 records at unique identifier level. A total of 5 columns were input into the model, namely: 1) Age, 2) Number of visits, 3) First visit 4) and Last visit during membership and 5) Tenure. The later representing the number of days holding a membership hence the time-to-event target variable. The visit-based variables are a feature engineered product for this study generated from the original, existing variables and by performing some calculations and aggregation on the raw data for each identifier over the period under analysis. Finally and very importantly, the dataset is ONLY composed of uncensored records. This is, all unique identifiers have experienced the event by the time of the analysis, namely membership cancellation. Therefore there is no censored data in this analysis where individuals survived (did not cancel their membership) beyond their observed duration. This is key when selecting the modelling technique as I will explain next.</p><p id="0511" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">Among all different techniques used in survival analysis, three stand out as most commonly used:</p><p id="90ce" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">Kaplan-Meier Estimator.</p><ul class=""><li id="0cd8" class="nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx oi oj ok bk">This is a non-parametric model hence no assumptions on the distribution of the data is made.</li><li id="652a" class="nc nd fq ne b go ol ng nh gr om nj nk nl on nn no np oo nr ns nt op nv nw nx oi oj ok bk">KM is not interested on how individual features affect churn thus it does not offer feature-based insights.</li><li id="8971" class="nc nd fq ne b go ol ng nh gr om nj nk nl on nn no np oo nr ns nt op nv nw nx oi oj ok bk">It is widely used for exploratory analysis to assess what the survival curve looks like.</li><li id="1dfd" class="nc nd fq ne b go ol ng nh gr om nj nk nl on nn no np oo nr ns nt op nv nw nx oi oj ok bk">Very importantly, it does not provide personalized predictions.</li></ul><p id="c57f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">Cox Proportional Hazard (PH) Model</p><ul class=""><li id="0811" class="nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx oi oj ok bk">The Cox PH Model is a semi-parametric model so it does not assume any specific distribution of the survival time, making it more flexible for a wider range of data.</li><li id="21cc" class="nc nd fq ne b go ol ng nh gr om nj nk nl on nn no np oo nr ns nt op nv nw nx oi oj ok bk">It estimates the hazard function.</li><li id="1a59" class="nc nd fq ne b go ol ng nh gr om nj nk nl on nn no np oo nr ns nt op nv nw nx oi oj ok bk">It relies heavily on uncensored as well as censored data to be able to differentiate between individuals “at risk” of experiencing the event versus those who already had the event. Thus, if only uncensored data is analyzed the model assumes all individuals experienced the event yielding bias results thus leading the Cox PH to perform poorly.</li></ul><p id="ee0e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">AFT Model</p><ul class=""><li id="ee76" class="nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx oi oj ok bk">It does not require censor data.

Now, in terms of The Concordance Index and AIC, the LogNormal and Weibull are both shown with the highest C-Index value BUT specifically the LogNormal Model dominating due to a lower AIC.

This is: each additional year of age represents a 6% decrease in survival time when the later is multiplied by a factor of 0.94 (exp(coef)) hence accelerating the survival time.

This is the model with the weakest ability to correctly rank survival times based on the predicted risk scores. This highlights an important aspect about model performance: regardless of the model ability to capture the correct direction of the effect across predictors, this does not necessarily guarantee predictive accuracy, specifically the ability to discriminate across subjects who experience the event sooner versus later as measured by the concordance index. The C-index explicitly evaluates ranking accuracy of the model as opposed to absolute accuracy. This is a fundamental distinction lying at the heart of this analysis, which I will expand next.</p><p id="4301" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">CONCORDANCE INDEX (C-INDEX)</p><p id="684e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">A “ranked survival time” refers to the predicted risk scores produced by the model for each individual and used to rank hence discriminate individuals who experience the event earlier when compared to those who experience the event later. Concordance Index is a measure of ranking accuracy rather than absolute accuracy, specifically: the C-index assesses the proportion of all pairs of individuals whose predicted survival time align with the actual outcome. In absolute terms, there is no concern on how precise the model is on predicting the exact number of days it took for the member to cancel its membership, instead how accurate the model ranks individuals when the actual and predicted time it took for a member to cancel its membership align. The below illustrate this:</p><figure class="mm mn mo mp mq mr mj mk paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="ms mt ed mu bh mv"><div class="mj mk pg"><img src="../Images/82c94a64cf82f0d302f1eecdce0ef3bf.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*O-OIXItdvFUyRUXbsL-C-A.png"/></div></div><figcaption class="mx my mz mj mk na nb bf b bg z dx">Drawn by the author based on instances: actual and estimate values from the validation dataset.</figcaption></figure><p id="2276" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">The two instances above are taken from the validation set after the model was trained on the training set and predictions were generated for unseen data. These examples illustrate cases where the predicted survival time (as estimated by the model) exceeds the actual survival time. The horizontal parallel lines represent time.</p><p id="b398" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">For Member 1, the actual membership duration was 390 days, whereas the model predicted a duration of 486 days — an overestimation of 96 days. Similarly, Member 2’s actual membership duration was 1,003 days, but the model predicted the membership cancellation to occur 242 days later than it actually did, this is 1,245 days membership duration.</p><p id="d72b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">Despite these discrepancies in absolute predictions (and this is important): the model correctly ranked the two members in terms of risk, accurately predicting that Member 1 would cancel their membership before Member 2. This distinction between absolute error and relative ranking is a critical aspect of model evaluation. Consider the following hypothetical scenario:</p><figure class="mm mn mo mp mq mr mj mk paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="ms mt ed mu bh mv"><div class="mj mk ph"><img src="../Images/d128dc056d21d1e8ea2183a79466a05e.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*8qcPSvpJ3XAIGXQmvMVZ8g.png"/></div></div><figcaption class="mx my mz mj mk na nb bf b bg z dx">Drawn by the author based on instances: actual and estimate values from the validation dataset.</figcaption></figure><p id="a346" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">if the model had predicted a membership duration of 1,200 days for Member 1 instead of 486 days, this would not affect the ranking. The model would still predict that Member 1 terminates their membership earlier than Member 2, regardless of the magnitude of the error in the prediction (i.e., the number of days). In survival analysis, any prediction for Member 1 that falls before the dotted line in the graph would maintain the same ranking, classifying this as a <em class="oh">concordant pair</em>. This concept is central to calculating the <strong class="ne fr">C-index</strong>, which measures the proportion of all pairs that are concordant in the dataset.</p><p id="340a" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">A couple of hypothetical scenarios are shown below. In each of them, the magnitude of the error increases/decreases, namely the difference between the actual event time and the predicted event time, this is the absolute error. However, the ranking accuracy remains unchanged.</p><figure class="mm mn mo mp mq mr mj mk paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="ms mt ed mu bh mv"><div class="mj mk pi"><img src="../Images/720d6f5ad2973eeaff3d1f2bc7cb33d5.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*Uwe9-YBFq-kkwBnWP6iO8A.png"/></div></div><figcaption class="mx my mz mj mk na nb bf b bg z dx">Drawn by the author based on instances: actual and estimate values from the validation dataset.</figcaption></figure><p id="3263" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">The below are also taken from the validation set BUT for these instances the model predicts the termination of the membership before the actual event occurs. For Member 3, the actual membership duration is 528 days, but the model predicted termination 130 days earlier, namely 398 membership duration. Similarly, for Member 4, the model anticipates the termination of membership before the actual event. In both cases, the model correctly ranks Member 4 to terminate their membership before Member 3.</p><figure class="mm mn mo mp mq mr mj mk paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="ms mt ed mu bh mv"><div class="mj mk pj"><img src="../Images/1cc01ce88e8b9b4eaa36c5ca855ccdb4.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*wBNiod5qV2AkRX5Sb_v17w.png"/></div></div><figcaption class="mx my mz mj mk na nb bf b bg z dx">Drawn by the author based on instances: actual and estimate values from the validation dataset.</figcaption></figure><p id="0d18" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">In the hypothetical scenario below, even if the model had predicted the termination 180 days earlier for Member 3, the ranking would remain unchanged. This would still be classified as a <em class="oh">concordant pair</em>. We can repeat this analysis multiple times and in 88% of cases, the LogNormal Model will produce this result, as indicated by the concordance index. This is: where the model correctly predicts the relative ordering of the individuals’ survival times.</p><figure class="mm mn mo mp mq mr mj mk paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="ms mt ed mu bh mv"><div class="mj mk pk"><img src="../Images/9f519daebd45135cdad614e63f3b991e.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*06K89KM28Ua4DcbhCEKLwg.png"/></div></div><figcaption class="mx my mz mj mk na nb bf b bg z dx">Drawn by the author based on instances: actual and estimate values from the validation dataset.</figcaption></figure><p id="087f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">As everything, the key is to identify when strategically to use survival analysis based on the task at hand. Use cases focusing on ranking individuals employing survival analysis as the most efficient strategy as opposed to focus on reducing the absolute error are:</p><p id="276f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk"><em class="oh">Customer retention — Businesses</em> rank customers by their likelihood of churning. Survival Analysis would allow to identify the most at risk customers to target retention efforts.</p><p id="4ba7" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk"><em class="oh">Employee attrition — HR analysis</em> Organizations use survival analysis to predict and rank employees by their likelihood of leaving the company. Similar to the above, allowing to identify most at risk employees. This aiming to improve retention rates and reducing turnover costs.</p><p id="769b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk"><em class="oh">Healthcare — resource allocation</em> survival models might be used to rank patients based on their risk of adverse outcomes (i.e. disease progression). In here, correctly identifying which patients are at the highest risk and need urgent intervention, allowing to allocate limited resources more effectively is more critical hence more relevant than the exact survival time.</p><p id="c3f2" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk"><em class="oh">Credit risk — finance</em> Financial institutions employ survival models to rank borrowers based on their risk of default. Thus, they are more concerned on identifying the riskiest customers to make more informed lending decisions rather than focusing on the exact month of default. This would positively guide loan approvals (among others).</p><p id="2e64" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">On the above, the <strong class="ne fr">relative ranking</strong> of subjects (e.g., who is at higher or lower risk) directly drives actionable decisions and resource allocation. Absolute error in survival time predictions may not significantly affect the outcomes, as long as the ranking accuracy (C-index) remains high. This demonstrates why models with high C-index can be highly effective, even when their absolute predictions are less precise.</p><p id="e30f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">IN SUMMARY</p><p id="1c19" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">In survival analysis, it is crucial to distinguish between <strong class="ne fr">absolute error</strong> and <strong class="ne fr">ranking accuracy</strong>. Absolute error refers to the difference between the predicted and actual event times, in this analysis measured in days. Metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are used to quantify the magnitude of these discrepancies hence measuring the overall predictive accuracy of the model. However, these metrics do not capture the model’s ability to correctly rank subjects by their likelihood of experiencing the event sooner or later.</p><p id="dafc" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk"><strong class="ne fr">Ranking accuracy, </strong>on the other hand evaluates how well the model orders subjects based on their predicted risk, regardless of the exact time prediction as illustrated above. This is where the <strong class="ne fr">concordance index (C-index)</strong> plays a key role. The C-index measures the model’s ability to correctly rank pairs of individuals, with higher values indicating better ranking accuracy. A C-index of 0.88 suggests that the model successfully ranks the risk of membership termination correctly 88% of the time.</p><p id="5b57" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">Thus, while absolute error provides valuable insights into the precision of time predictions, the C-index focuses on the model’s ability to rank subjects correctly, which is often more important in survival analysis. A model with a high C-index can be highly effective in ranking individuals, even if it has some degree of absolute error, making it a powerful tool for predicting relative risks over time.</p></div></div></div></div>
