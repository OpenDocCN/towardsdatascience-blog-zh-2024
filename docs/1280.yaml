- en: Statistical significance is today a pillar of scientific inquiry, but my recent
    finding of a plea signed by over 800 researchers in the journal *Nature* a few
    years ago brought back to me some long-standing ideas and thoughts about statistical
    tests having the effect of screwing up a good portion of scientific research rather
    than helping it.

- en: 'Traditionally, research findings are classified into “significant” or “non-significant”
    categories based on a predefined p-value threshold, say 0.05 or 0.01 or 0.001
    (these are typical thresholds used in chemical and biological sciences, and certainly
    differ from those used in other domains). A first problem with this shows up especially
    among non-experts, who simply misinterpret the result: a non-significant result
    doesn’t negate the presence of an effect; rather, it indicates a lack of conclusive
    evidence for it. But beyond this, there are other more general problems that I
    will discuss next, which can affect even experts, especially when there are hidden
    biases and conflicts of interest, possibly exacerbated in very…'
