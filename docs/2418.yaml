    refer to as the “self-satisfaction of IT.”

    again. It can be frustrating to see **IT departments actually working against
    their business**.

- en: I remember one specific case where a running **business solution** had to be
    **migrated** to another execution platform solely **because of ‘technical’ reasons**.
    Sure, business was told that this target platform would be much cheaper in maintenance,
    but IT didn’t offer tangible evidence on that assertion. Ultimately, the decision
    to migrate was driven by **‘expert knowledge’ and so-called ‘best practices’**,
    but solely from an IT-centric perspective.It cost a fortune to migrate what worked,
    only to find out that the **promised cost reductions didn’t materialize** and
    even worse, business functionality deteriorated in some cases.
