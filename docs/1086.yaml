    most of their genes with mammals: 98 to 99 percent with chimpanzees and roughly
    90 percent with mice, dogs, and cats. The degree of gene overlapping indicates
    how closely the species are related to the same ancestors. It is also the foundation
    for scientists to use animal models to study the neural mechanisms of human intelligence.
    For example, [the mechanisms of learning and memory that inspired AI deep learning](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/from-biological-learning-to-artificial-neural-network-whats-next-c8cf0d351af5)
    came mainly from the studies of the rat hippocampus and the neural net of Aplasia,
    an invertebrate animal living in the sea.'

    such as: What kind of brain function and intelligence do we share with the animal
    kingdom? What is unique about the human brain, if any? Is artificial general intelligence
    (AGI) a sensible goal for AI? What role will AI play in the evolution coming ahead
    of us?'

    roots of many human daily behaviors are much more ancient than we initially thought,
    we will have much deeper insights into our behaviors, perception, and cognition,
    particularly why humans have…
