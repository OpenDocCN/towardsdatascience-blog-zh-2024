    that your day-to-day has shifted from a VSCode-loving, research paper-reading,
    git-version-committing data scientist to a collaboration-driving, project-scoping,
    stakeholder-managing, and strategy-setting individual.

    you to put on different hats to ensure data initiatives are on track and impactful.
    It is at this point that you will start to notice the need for honing some business
    skills, in addition to your usual data science skills. This will also be a good
    indication that you are ready to aim for senior tech leadership roles such as
    Principal, Lead, or Staff DS.

- en: Knowing how a business makes money is crucial regardless of the size of the
    company and your role in it. Unfortunately, a lot of data science work often happens
    in silos where the problem statement or hypothesis, or analysis workflow is top-down
    and may lack direct alignment with the company’s financial goals.
  prefs: []

- en: As you take on a more senior leadership role with the team, it is essential
    that you **speak the language of business**. Having a broad understanding of terms
    like CapEx vs. OpEx, EBITDA margin, amortization, blended CAC, churn cohorts,
    fair share index, etc. is helpful when you are communicating the results to the
    higher-ups. This way, you can tailor your insights to highlight how data science-driven
    initiatives will impact these areas, making your analysis more relevant and convincing
    to financial stakeholders.

    shares in the market = higher earnings per share (EPS), which boosts the stock

    numbers means that you know what’s working and not working for the business, identify
    areas for growth, and make sound financial choices based on data. For instance,
    instead of just showing improved model accuracy, one could demonstrate exactly
    how the predictions would impact the bottom line.'

    many data scientists miss. For instance, there are [schemes](https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/capital-allowances-manual/ca60000)

    with R&D activity (like patent-related costs, specialized software licenses, etc).

    for projects in agri-tech innovation.

    tools, techniques, and trends. In practical terms, this would translate as knowing
    (a) which models sit on top of the [leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_leaderboard)
    for your usecase (be it forecasting, generative AI, or computer vision), (b) any
    new groundbreaking frameworks that would be game-changers for your field (for
    instance, Baidu recently unveiled [iRAG technology](https://www.aibase.com/news/13150)

    in DevOps/LLMOps/MLOps that could streamline workflows and improve efficiency.

    the broader ethical and societal impacts of these technologies — especially as
    governments around the world are taking steps to regulate the tech domain.

    partnership turning sour](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/technology/microsoft-openai-partnership-deal.html),

    by companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, to meet the growing demand for
    high energy consumption by large language models (LLMs), often seen as a bottleneck
    for AI advancements. A stable, predictable, and carbon-free energy source could
    mean long-term cost savings for your AI-driven business.
