- en: Segment Anything Model 2 is Meta's latest image segmentation model, capable
    of detecting and marking objects in images and code. This article will show you
    how to download and utilize the model and review the model and its capabilities.
    Using image segmentation models is exciting as you can immediately see the model’s
    results and understand how well it performs, as segmentation is a task your brain
    is good at itself. You can, therefore, quickly judge whether an image segmentation
    model is performing well.

- en: My motivation for this article is my series on keeping up with the latest models
    within machine learning. SAM2 is a recently released model from Meta, a company
    that consistently produces advanced open-source machine-learning models. I have
    previously written about [Amazon’s Chronos forecasting model](/how-to-effectively-forecast-time-series-with-amazons-new-time-series-forecasting-model-9e04d4ccf67e),
    [Llama3](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/unleash-llama3-how-you-can-use-the-latest-big-tech-open-source-llm-3bae9c3f5cd0),
    and several other AI models. This article will focus on SAM2, with how you can
    use the model yourself, what tasks you can apply the model to, and how well the
    model performs. This model is also released under an Apache 2.0 license, meaning
    you are free to use the model in a commercial setting, which, in my opinion, makes
    the model even…
