- en: For the last four years, I have been experimenting with and writing about the
    creative uses of AI and ML. I have researched and kept up-to-date with the latest
    tools for 2D and 3D image editing, music composition, and creative writing. My
    work has focused on how these tools can assist and enhance various forms of artistic
    expression.

- en: For this article, I explored the application of AI/ML for image editing, evaluating
    both commercial and open-source tools. I examined Adobe Photoshop and Runway ML
    alongside open-source systems like Stable Diffusion 2 and InstructPix2Pix. Each
    tool offers various image editing features, such as inpainting and style transfer.
    My goal was to assess their practical applications, usability, and limitations
    to understand how they can aid in creative expression. I experimented by editing
    images I had created for prior articles, showing the potential for these tools
    to enhance and modify existing artwork.
