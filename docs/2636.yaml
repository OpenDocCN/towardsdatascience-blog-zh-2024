- en: Conference attendance has been a frequent occurrence for me as a data professional
    since my early career days. The field of data science is so vast and diverse.
    While that means that there is a huge variety of data roles and practitioners
    out there, it could also mean that no matter how small your niche, or how specific
    and esoteric your specific problem is, there is always someone else out there
    with the same problem in a different company. The proof is in the endless number
    of questions and memes in Stack Overflow /Kaggle threads and other knowledge-base
    forums. During my early career connecting with the data community out there was
    so helpful for me to learn novel techniques and apply new knowledge to some of
    the old problems I was solving and become a more efficient analyst.

    as a speaker and having a seat at the table with expert panels and the speaker
    lounges has been a game changer. It has helped me immensely to think creatively
    about my job and role in Data Stewardship and become a better data mentor and
    steward for folks who rely on my expertise. I recently attended Data Connect 2024
    as a speaker. While most of the conferences happening in the past couple of years
    have been heavily focused on AI, I was fortunate enough to learn about the following
    three critical aspects of Data Analytics and management that I could easily apply
    in my day-to-day responsibilities. In this article, I’ll be sharing my interpretation
    and learnings from these sessions, action items, and my reflections on these crucial
    data topics as a data practitioner of over 12 years.

    and becomes an official metric that gets tracked and shared out consistently.
    Cost containment has been on my mind for me both as an Individual Contributor
    and a Team Lead, starting from my days as an Analytics Intern. Who can forget
    their first time letting their un-optimized SQL query with full outer joins run
    for several hours before getting a warning call from their org’s DBA? (Not me
    !) Ever since then, Cost containment has been one of those concepts that has been
    living rent-free in my brain. Many data solutions providers have switched from
    a Tier-based pricing model to a consumption-based pricing model which makes cost
    optimization an essential tool in the data management and leadership toolkit.

    when inefficient data practices are in place. For instance, apart from running
    extensive queries, even failing to archive unused data can lead to substantial
    increases in data storage costs. To manage such unexpected expenses, it is crucial
    to implement effective cost management strategies. This includes monitoring usage
    patterns, optimizing queries, and setting up alerts for unusual activity. By understanding
    these hidden costs, teams can better control their data tools’ pricing, ensuring
    a sustainable data ROI. I also learned about the importance of investing in training
    data teams to optimize their use of analytics tools. Educating staff on cost-efficient
    query writing and data handling ensures that resources are utilized to their full
    potential is often overlooked, but it is one of the low-hanging fruits that can
    be effective in cutting costs.

    usage. This oversight can result in substantial unanticipated expenses, particularly
    when scaling operations rapidly. To avoid these pitfalls, it is essential for
    organizations to maintain open communication with vendors, closely monitor data
    usage, and regularly review contract terms. By anticipating changes and preparing
    for potential cost fluctuations, businesses can better manage their data tools
    pricing and ensure their data ROI remains positive.

    comprehensive dashboards that provide real-time insights into spending patterns.
    These tools should highlight daily, weekly, and monthly cost trends, enabling
    teams to spot irregularities swiftly. Additionally, setting up automated alerts
    for unusual usage or spending spikes can further safeguard against budget overruns.'

    ROI, the other side of this coin is measuring the worth and effectiveness of Data
    Analytics efforts and eventually the data teams. As I was wrapping up my notes
    from listening to a talk related to Data Analytics Team efficiencies, one of the
    moderators sparked up an interesting discussion related to “Data Translation”
    and the need for dedicated organizational efforts to bridge the literacy gaps
    between Data and Business teams.

- en: As data infrastructure and data team hiring costs have been consistently increasing,
    it’s crucial for businesses to see a return on this investment. High costs can
    be justified only if the data team’s work translates into actionable insights
    that drive business growth, innovation, and efficiency. Without clear value, these
    expenses can seem burdensome. Data leaders need to ensure that their teams are
    aligned with business objectives and are working on projects that offer substantial
    returns. By effectively managing these costs, organizations can maintain a competitive
    edge and leverage data as a strategic asset. This requires thoughtful allocation
    of resources, prioritization of impactful projects, and fostering a culture of
    data literacy to maximize the utility and influence of the data team across the
    organization.

    between public speaking tactics and the data storytelling tactics we often learn
    in our jobs. The process of brainstorming and picking a well-rounded topic, being
    okay with imperfections, and finally getting it all mapped into an overall governing
    idea made me reflect on how Data storytelling is much more than pretty charts
    and documenting patterns. I also got to listen to a great presentation focusing
    on Effective visual communication tips for data presentations. I learned that
    by integrating narrative with data visualization, you engage both the logical
    and emotional sides of your audience’s brain, making your insights more memorable.
    This approach ensures that data isn’t just seen as numbers on a page but as a
    critical driver of strategic decisions. I also learned that aligning your data
    story with the audience’s needs and data literacy is the easiest way to encourage
    them to take meaningful action based on the data.

    should align with your core message and provide insight into the story you’re
    telling. Use color strategically to highlight key data points and maintain audience
    focus. Consistency and contrast are key elements in effective color usage.'

    and learn new concepts. While AI-adjacent topics have dominated most of the conference
    agendas over the past couple of years for very valid reasons, I was deeply grateful
    to learn about these three crucial Data management advancements that helped solidify
    my foundational knowledge, Data communication skills, and tap into the collective
    hive mind of experienced Data Subject matter experts to solve problems that are
    as ubiquitous as AI.
