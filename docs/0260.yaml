- en: Over the years, I have seen and worked on numerous Python scripts within the
    geoscience and petrophysics domains. In that time, I have seen (and also written)
    a variety of coding styles, from well-organised code that is well-documented to
    everything in a single Python file with little to no organisation. With the latter,
    it can be difficult to maintain, debug and understand when the code is revisited
    several months later. The purpose of writing the code will often dictate the style
    used.

    strict time constraints and pressures, then we may not be able to make things
    as pretty and organised as we would like. However, if we are creating code that
    we will use multiple times or are deploying it to other users, and if we have
    the time, we may want to structure the code or app in a way that will make it
    suitable for expansion later on. This can save time and headaches when you revisit
    your code and also avoids the dilemma of forgetting what the code does or was
    intended to do.
