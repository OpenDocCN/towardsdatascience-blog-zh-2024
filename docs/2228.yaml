    to understand trends in the data science discipline. A couple of points that really
    stood out were that *“Very few individuals (less than 2%) have stayed at the same
    job for more than 5 years” [1]* and ***“****The median**time spent on the job**by
    a data scientist in our study was 1.7 years” [1]*. Fortunately, I haven’t seen
    this turnover in my teams, but I know many data scientists, and most argue that
    **‘lack of role clarity’** is one of their top 3 challenges. If you feel this
    is happening to you or in your team, I hope this article helps you build a competency
    framework which is adaptable, fair and robust to provide answers for this ‘lack
    of role clarity’.
