- en: Lake Mendota in Madison Wisconsin is arguably one of the [most-studied](https://integrativebiology.wisc.edu/2022/03/22/lake-mendota-said-to-be-most-studied-lake-in-the-world/)
    lakes in the world and boasts an ice phenology record dating back to the 1850’s.
    The Climatology Office at the University of Wisconsin, which currently maintains
    the record, has made amazing strides to make the data [downloadable](https://climatology.nelson.wisc.edu/first-order-station-climate-data/madison-climate/lake-ice/history-of-ice-freezing-and-thawing-on-lake-mendota/).
    However, a simple plot of the ice-on date over time still requires some work by
    the user to make it legible. This is the reason I created [*mendotapy*](https://mendotapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)*,*
    an open source (MIT-licensed) Python package that allows retrieval of this valuable
    data in an analysis-ready format. It has some built-in utilities to make common
    transformations a breeze.

- en: I find this dataset interesting from a climate perspective, but I think anybody
    can find this dataset relevant. For instance, it could be used as a toy dataset
    to practice regression analysis, statistical forecasting, or spectral analysis.

- en: In this post, I will describe the package, present some plots of the data, and
    conclude with the challenges I faced making this package. All the code to generate
    the figures is available in this post and the package code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/lgloege/mendotapy)
    (contributions are welcome)
