    did not outperform other models.

- en: Looking at the Makridakis M-competition, the winning solutions always relied
    on statistical models. Until the M4 competition, winning solutions were either
    pure statistical or a hybrid of ML and statistical models. Pure ML approaches
    barely surpassed the competition baseline.

    in 2020\. The authors published N-BEATS, a promising pure Deep Learning approach.
    The model beat the winning solution of the M4 competition. It was the first pure
    Deep Learning approach that outperformed well-established statistical approaches.

- en: In this article, I will go through the architecture behind N-BEATS. But do not
    be afraid, the deep dive will be easy-to-understand. I also show you how we can
    make the deep learning approach interpretable. However, it is not enough to only
    understand how N-BEATS works. Thus, I will show you how…
