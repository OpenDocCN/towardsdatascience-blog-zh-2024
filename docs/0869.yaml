- en: Time series forecasting has been evolving towards foundation models due to their
    success in other artificial intelligence (AI) areas. Particularly, we have been
    witnessing the success of such approaches in natural language processing (NLP).
    The cadence of the development of foundational models has been accelerating over
    time. A new, more powerful Large Language Model (LLM) is released every month.
    This is not restricted to NLP. We see a similar growing pattern in computer vision
    as well. Segmentation models like Meta’s Segment Anything Model (SAM) [1] can
    identify and accurately segment objects in unseen images. Multimodal models such
    as LLaVa [2] or Qwen-VL [3] can handle text and images to answer any user question.
    The common characteristic between these models is that they can perform accurate
    zero-shot inference, meaning that they do not need to be trained in your data
    to have an excellent performance.

- en: Defining what a foundational model is and what makes it different from traditional
    approaches is probably beneficial at this point. First, a foundational model is
    large-scale (namely its training), which provides a broad understanding of the
    main patterns and important nuances we can find in the…
