- en: The struggle to achieve dominant design within the lifecycle of technology innovation
    has been the topic of intense study over the last half century. These battles
    play out within research and development (R&D) labs, in discussions on strategy
    around commercialization and marketing, and in the media and consumer space, but
    ultimately in the hearts and minds of the customers who turn the tide of market
    share and product acceptance through their everyday selections of capability.
    It is why history remembers VHS and not Betamax, why we type on a QWERTY keyboard,
    and how the industry changed after the introduction of Google’s search engine
    or Apple’s iPhone. The emergence of ChatGPT was a signal to the market that we
    are in the midst of yet another battle for dominant design, this time involving
    generative AI.

    has the potential to revolutionize industries by enhancing creativity, automating
    tasks, and enhancing customer experiences. As a result, organizations are hastily
    investing in this ecosystem of capabilities in order to remain relevant and competitive.
    As business leaders, government agencies, and investors make decisions on technologies
    within the rapidly evolving field of generative AI, from chips to platforms to
    models, they should do so with the concept of dominant design in mind and how
    technologies eventually coalesce around this notion as they mature.

    Model[[i]](https://medium.com/@geoffrey.m.williams1/the-business-implications-of-dominant-design-on-the-trajectory-of-generative-ai-a1240bea6eb3#_edn1)[[ii]](https://medium.com/@geoffrey.m.williams1/the-business-implications-of-dominant-design-on-the-trajectory-of-generative-ai-a1240bea6eb3#_edn2)
    in 1975, although the term was not formally coined until twenty years later[[iii]](https://medium.com/@geoffrey.m.williams1/the-business-implications-of-dominant-design-on-the-trajectory-of-generative-ai-a1240bea6eb3#_edn3).
    This concept went on to become so foundational that it continues to be taught
    to MBA students in schools across the country. At its most basic core, this business
    model describes how a product’s design and manufacturing processes evolve over
    time through three distinct phases: an initial **Fluid Phase** characterized by
    significant experimentation in both product design and process improvement with
    significant innovation as different approaches are developed and refined to meet
    market needs, a **Transitional Phase** where a dominant product design begins
    to emerge and the market gradually shifts towards increasing product standardization
    but with substantial process innovation, and a **Specific Phase** marked by standardization
    across product and process designs.'

    to account for technological dominance dynamics that precede the introduction
    of a product to the market and can serve as a roadmap to navigate this process.

    is influenced by a number of firm-level factors (e.g., technological superiority,
    complementary assets, installed user base, strategic maneuvering) and environmental
    factors (e.g., industry regulation, network effects, switching costs, appropriability
    regime, market characteristics). Each of these factors have differing levels of
    importance in a given stage, with actions occurring too early or too late within
    the process having muted or unintended effects. Work has also been conducted to
    consider how sequential decisions on three key aspects (i.e., the market, the
    technology, complementary assets) can help determine success or failure in the
    battle for dominance[[](https://medium.com/@geoffrey.m.williams1/the-business-implications-of-dominant-design-on-the-trajectory-of-generative-ai-a1240bea6eb3#_edn1)[v](https://medium.com/@geoffrey.m.williams1/the-business-implications-of-dominant-design-on-the-trajectory-of-generative-ai-a1240bea6eb3#_ednref5)[]](https://medium.com/@geoffrey.m.williams1/the-business-implications-of-dominant-design-on-the-trajectory-of-generative-ai-a1240bea6eb3#_edn1).
    The first decision relates to the market and the decisions needed to correctly
    visualize the market to drive the actions to achieve a superior installed user
    base. The second decision relates to whether the market standard is government
    or market driven and includes a consideration of a strategy of proprietary control
    vs one of openness. The third and final decision relates to the strategy to cultivate
    access to the complementary assets required to be competitive in a mainstream

    and the impact of previous outcomes (e.g., the cloud wars, AI chip investments)
    on the course of future events. Modern, complex technologies often operate within
    a regime of increasing returns to adoption, in that the more a technology is adopted,
    the more beneficial and entrenched it becomes[[vi]](https://medium.com/@geoffrey.m.williams1/the-business-implications-of-dominant-design-on-the-trajectory-of-generative-ai-a1240bea6eb3#_edn6).
    Within this context, small historical events can have a strong influence in which
    technology ultimately becomes dominant, despite the potential advantages of competing
    technologies. This results from several reinforcing mechanisms such as learning
    effects, coordination effects, and adaptive expectations that make switching to
    another technology costly and complex. Moreover, the transition of enterprise-scale
    generative AI from R&D to commercialized product with business and operational
    value is intertwined with cloud infrastructure dominance[[vii]](https://medium.com/@geoffrey.m.williams1/the-business-implications-of-dominant-design-on-the-trajectory-of-generative-ai-a1240bea6eb3#_edn7).
    This is necessitated by the need for a common set of capabilities coupled with
    large scale computational resources. To provide such capabilities, hyperscalers
    have seamlessly integrated cloud infrastructure, models, and applications into
    the cloud AI stack — accelerating the creation of complementary assets. It is
    through the lens of these considerations that the developments in generative AI
    are examined.

    models (LLMs) had practical, commercial application on a broad scale. Within weeks,
    the term generative AI was known across generations of users, technical and non-technical
    alike. Even more profound was the realization by other participants in the market
    that they needed to either initiate or significantly accelerate their own efforts
    to deliver generative AI capability. This marked the transition from Phase 2:
    Technical Feasibility to Phase 3: Creating the Market. From there, the race was
    on.'

    own generative AI platforms and associated models (e.g., Meta AI — February 2023,
    AWS Bedrock — April 2023, Palantir Artificial Intelligence Platform — April 2023,
    Google Vertex AI — June 2023, IBM WatsonX.ai — July 2023). Where technology and
    technological talent were of greatest importance in proving technical feasibility,
    this has given way to strategic maneuvering as firms work to position themselves
    for growth with a focus on building up the installed user base, developing complementary
    assets and ecosystems, and enhancing networking effects. This is leading to the
    current period of rapid expansion of strategic partnerships across hyperscaler
    ecosystems and with key AI providers as organizations seek to form the alliances
    that will help them weather the decisive battle for dominance. We are also seeing
    hyperscalers leverage their existing cloud infrastructure assets to pull their
    generative AI assets through regulatory hurdles at an accelerated pace in niche
    markets with little to no competition.

    one, AI companies that invest in alternative approaches that do not become the
    dominant design may find themselves at a disadvantage. Consequently, adapting
    to or adopting the dominant design could require significant shifts in strategy,
    development, and investment beyond current sunk costs. Additionally, competition
    will continue to increase as the generative AI market’s potential becomes more
    evident, increasing pressure on all market participants and eventually leading
    to consolidation and exits. Lastly, the pervasiveness of AI is leading world governments
    and institutions to begin updating regulatory frameworks to promote security and
    the responsible deployment of AI. This is introducing added uncertainty as organizations
    may face new compliance requirements which can be resource-intensive to implement.
    In markets with heavy regulation, this may prove a barrier to being able to even
    provide generative AI tools, if those tools do not meet basic requirements.

    to identify front runners in the battle for dominant design, organizations that
    can quickly align with the dominant design(s) or innovate within those frameworks
    are better positioned to capture significant market share. Also, even as the market
    begins to standardize around a dominant design, new niches can emerge within the

    market stability and industry-wide standardization, which will lead to increased
    market adoption and reduced uncertainty among businesses and consumers alike.
    Companies that can influence or adapt to emerging dominant designs will secure
    competitive advantages, establishing themselves as market leaders in the new technological
    paradigm. However, selecting a product ecosystem that ultimately does not become
    the standard will lead to diminishing market share and exact switching costs upon
    the firms that will now need to transition to the dominant design.

    evolving technological landscapes means that organizations must stay vigilant
    and flexible, ready to pivot their strategies in response to new developments
    in AI technology and shifts in consumer demands. Businesses that can envision
    the trajectory of technological change and proactively respond to it will not
    only endure but also stand out as pioneers in the new era of digital transformation.
