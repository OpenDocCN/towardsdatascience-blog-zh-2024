    something out quickly to move ahead with your day. More often than not, though,
    if you’d like to *truly* learn about a new topic, there is no substitute for spending
    some time with it.

    side (some of them could easily become a short book!), but they reward readers
    with top-notch writing, nuanced explanations, and a well-rounded approach to the
    question or problem at hand. We’ve published some excellent articles in this category
    recently, and wanted to make sure you don’t miss out.'

    [Nate Cibik](https://medium.com/u/82bf2304955e?source=post_page---user_mention--a6baf108db0c--------------------------------)’s
    comprehensive guide to quantization might be an 81-minute read, but we promise
    it’s worth the investment: it’s a one-stop resource to understand the mathematical
    underpinning of this ever-relevant approach, catch up with recent research, and
    learn about the practical aspects of implementation, too.'
