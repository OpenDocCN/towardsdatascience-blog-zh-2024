    the sincere pleasure of mentoring many undergraduate students majoring in data
    science. What astounds me is how little engineering tactics are taught as a part
    of these programs. From students attending state schools to even Ivy League universities,
    I constantly hear that the emphasis is placed on pure data science skills. While
    these skills aren’t wrong by any means, it leaves a gaping hole in making a data
    scientist into a “full stack” data scientist.

    What I mean specifically is being able to make your predictive model usable in
    a production setting. It’s one set of skills to know how to build the model; it’s
    another to know how to make it usable by others!

    data science work itself. You don’t necessarily need to be an expert in any of
    these skills, but having a foundational level of knowledge is important nevertheless.
    Depending on the company you end up working for as a data scientist, there may
    very well be the expectation that…
