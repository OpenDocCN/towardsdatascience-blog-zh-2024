    have latched onto the idea that generative AI systems have been trained on datasets
    and foundation models that contained actual copyrighted image files, .jpgs, .gifs,
    .png files and the like, scraped from the internet, that somehow the dataset or
    foundation model must have made and stored copies of these works, and somehow
    the generative AI system further selected and copied individual images out of
    that dataset, and somehow the system copied and incorporated significant copyrightable
    parts of individual images into the final generated images that are offered to
    the end-user. This is magical thinking.

    which allows users to pick a model, see an output, and check ‚Äî from that model‚Äôs
    training data ‚Äî how similar the generated image is to any image in its training
    data. MNIST digits were used to generate because they are easy for the machine
    to parse, easy for humans to interpret in terms of similarity, and have the nice
    property of being easily classified ‚Äî allowing a hunt of similarity to only consider
    images that are of the same number (efficiency gains).

- en: The following image has a similarity score of .00039\. RMSE stands for Root
    Mean Squared Error and is a way of assessing the similarity between two images.
    True enough, many other methods for similarity assessment exist, but RMSE gives
    you a pretty good idea of whether an image is a duplicate or not (i.e., we are
    not hunting for a legal definition of similarity here). As an example, an RMSE
    of <.006 gets you into the nearly ‚Äúcopy‚Äù range, and an RMSE of <.0009 is entering
    perfect copy territory (indistinguishable to the naked eye).

    true for certain models performing certain tasks. We need to be careful and mindful
    of our ‚Äúback boxes‚Äù because this analogy often turns out not to be true. That
    you cannot interpret for yourself the set of weights held by a model does not
    mean you escape all forms of liability or scrutiny.
