    projects — the majority of which has been as a consultant — I have seen projects
    deliver incredible value to clients, but I have also seen projects stumble and

    Python and R wizard — acing Hackerrank data science programming competitions;
    it’s much deeper than that, being able to blend strategy, technology and analytics
    in project deliverables. In this article, I will draw insights from both successful
    and challenging projects and illustrate how data science consulting intersects
    with management, IT and analytics consulting. By understanding the differences
    and similarities between these more traditional and established consulting roles
    it becomes easier to see how we can deliver lasting and impactful solutions in
    our data science projects.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Management consulting projects and data science consulting projects usually
    share many of the same characteristics. They both try to enhance business performance
    and often deliver projects of strategic importance. They also usually involve
    senior executives — at least as project owners — and they both require detailed
    upfront planning. However, while I find that management consulting projects usually
    follow a traditional waterfall approach, data science consulting can benefit more
    from a hybrid approach that combines some of the structured planning from waterfall
    with agile iterations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Regarding deliverables, management consulting projects will typically produce
    strategic plans, organizational assessments or pricing recommendations, and they
    are often contained in a power point deck or and an excel workbook. This is in
    contrast to data science projects, where the main deliverables will typically
    be predictive models, data pipelines and dashboards.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The feedback cycles are also different, while the traditional management consulting
    projects will typically have planned periodic feedback, the data science consulting
    projects are more successful with continuous stakeholder involvement and iterative
    feedback cycles.

- en: IT consulting and data science consulting both require strong technical expertise
    and an understanding of IT infrastructure, and some people might argue that data
    science consulting is a subcategory of IT consulting. I don’t subscribe to that
    belief, but the two fields have a considerable overlap.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While IT consulting projects produces system architecture designs, implementation
    plans and more core system software development, data science consulting is more
    centered around generating predictive models, the pipelines that feed the models
    and data-driven insights.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, data science projects are often very closely connected to the
    business side of the organizations and will in many cases have leaders outside
    of IT as project owners and sponsors. For example, you can find yourself delivering
    directly to the CMO (Chief Marketing Officer) or the CDO (Chief Data Officer)
    instead of the CIO (Chief Information Officer) or CTO (Chief Technology Officer),
    as is often the case with more IT-driven projects. This means that your approach
    and method needs to be tailored differently than with pure IT projects, and you
    often need to make more considerations regarding continuity, operations and the
    maturity of the organization. (The CIOs and CTOs will already typically have more
    elaborate systems in place to deal with the above issues.)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, as data science has matured over the last years, we have seen fields
    like MLOps evolve significantly, and also a trend in projects to develop and write
    code closer to how modern software development is undertaken. I see this as a
    natural part of the evolution of data science towards a more professional and
    structured field.

    share a focus on data and typically involve shorter project durations with targeted
    deliverables. They also emphasize rapid iterations and continuous refinement based
    on data and feedback. However, analytics consulting often addresses specific business
    questions with more narrow scopes, while data science consulting integrates a
    broader strategic alignment and more complex models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The classical deliverables within analytics consulting would usually be data
    analysis reports, data marts and dashboards, whereas data science consulting deliverables
    — as we have mentioned previously — are more centered around pipelines, models
    and strategic and integrated data products.

    analytics projects are assessed more around the analysis accuracy and insights,
    the data science projects will typically in addition be measured on predictive
    accuracy and return on investment.

- en: While management consulting typically focuses on immediate organizational changes
    and one-off deliverables, data science consulting requires a long-term perspective
    on robustness and sustainability. This has a couple of consequences. You can and
    will be judged on the continued performance of your work and should take steps
    to ensure you deliver good results not just at the moment of handover, but also
    potentially for years to come. (This is similar to IT consulting, where ongoing
    performance and maintenance are essential.)

    6 years! I have seen the direct effects of having data pipelines that are not
    robust enough, leading to system crashes and erroneous model results. I have also
    seen model variables and labels drift significantly over time, leading to degradation
    of system performance and in some cases completely wrong insights.

    integrating them directly into your project timeline.

- en: Proper documentation and knowledge transfer is critical in data science consulting.
    Unlike analytics consulting, which might involve less complex models, data science
    projects require thorough documentation to ensure continuity. Clients often face
    personnel changes, and well-documented processes help mitigate the loss of information.
    I have on multiple occasions been contacted by previous clients and asked to explain
    various aspects of the models and systems we built. This is not always easy —
    especially when you haven’t seen the codebase for years— and it can be very handy
    to have properly documented Jupyter Notebooks or Markdown documents, describing
    the decision process and analysis. This ensures that any decisions or initial
    results can easily be traced back and resolved.

    Unlike analytics consulting, which might focus on delivering insights and reports,
    data science consulting needs to ensure the deployability and operationalization
    of models. This is similar to IT consulting, where integration into existing CI/CD
    pipelines is crucial.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’ve seen companies waste years from the development of a model to its production
    deployment due to personnel changes and unfinished integration tasks. If we had
    insisted on seeing the project through to full production ready status, the client
    would have had the full benefits of the model much earlier. A significant improvement
    when project costs can be in the millions of euros.

    the value created by the project. While management consulting deliverables include
    strategic plans and assessments — usually in the form of a one-off power point
    deck — data science consulting benefits from visual tools that provide ongoing
    insights into the impact and benefits of the solution. These artifacts serve as
    reminders of the project’s value and help in measuring its success, similar to
    the role of visualizations in analytics consulting.
  prefs: []

- en: One of my most successful projects was when we built a pricing solution for
    a client and they started using the dashboard component directly in their monthly
    pricing committee meetings. Even though the dashboard was only a small fraction
    of the project, it was the only thing that management and company executives could
    interact with, and thus provided a powerful reminder of our work.

    avoid over-engineering the solution. Tailoring the complexity of the solutions
    to the client’s maturity level ensures better adoption and usability. Always remember
    that when you are finished with the project, ownership usually shifts to internal
    data scientists and data engineers. If the client has a team of 20 data scientists
    and a modern data infrastructure ready to integrate your models directly into
    their existing DevOps, that’s amazing, but frequently not the case. Consider instead
    the scenario where you are developing a tool for a company with 20 employees,
    with only one junior data scientist and and an over-worked data engineer. How
    would you adapt your strategy?

    and often required in data science consulting. Unlike analytics consulting, which
    might not involve extensive coding, data science consulting should stay true to
    software development practices to ensure scalability and maintainability. This
    is similar to modern IT consulting, where writing modular, well-documented code
    and including sample data for testing are essential practices.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    transfer. Properly documented and structured code, packaged into easy to install
    software packages and libraries is much easier to maintain and manage than 1000s
    of lines of spaghetti code. When personnel changes occur, you will be in a much
    better spot if the code has been properly developed.

    data science consulting projects that drive long term value for your clients.
    I believe this is a necessity if you want to build a successful data science consulting
    business. My personal experiences highlight the importance of robust solutions,
    thorough documentation, end-to-end deliverables, visual artifacts, evaluating
    organizational maturity, and following IT development best practices in ensuring
