E.g. Casciaro et al. (2015) advocate for the integration of network and psychological perspectives in organizational scholarship, highlighting that such interdisciplinary approaches can significantly enrich our understanding of organizational behaviors and structures. They emphasize that combining these perspectives reveals complex dynamics within organizations that would otherwise remain obscured, especially in areas such as leadership, turnover, and team performance. This fusion not only advances theoretical models but also suggests practical implications for organizational management, urging further exploration of underrepresented areas and methodologies (Casciaro et al., 2015).</p><p id="ec74" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mx my fq mz b go na nb nc gr nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns fj bk">Brass (2012) emphasizes the importance of recognizing how personal attributes and network structures collectively impact organizational outcomes, suggesting that a dual focus on structural connections and individual characteristics is crucial for a deeper insight into organizational dynamics.</p><p id="d91a" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mx my fq mz b go na nb nc gr nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns fj bk">But why is that interesting?</p><p id="5d2f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mx my fq mz b go na nb nc gr nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns fj bk">Because according to Briganti et al.

The validity of social science research data has been the subject of a deep and serious concern in the past decades (Nederhof and Zwier, 1983) — and this was expressed in 1983! Traditional surveys often suffer from different types of biases.

Qualitative methods also suffer from limitations like the difficulty to unify and organize the results, researcher bias (Malterud, 2001), researchers’ confirmation bias (Nickerson, 1998), but in the age of LLMs, with proper prompting and automation, these limitations can be overcome.</p><p id="c90a" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mx my fq mz b go na nb nc gr nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns fj bk">I’ll present a simple LLM-based method to extract network relationships from natural language.

Average Workday:<br/>My typical day starts with a quick review of my to-do list, which I prepare the night before. <br/>I arrive at the office by 8 AM, settle in, and start with a 30-minute session to review the progress on ongoing projects against their timelines. <br/>At 8:30 AM, I hold a brief stand-up meeting with the team, which includes Josh, Leah, Carlos, and Fiona, to catch up on their progress and address any immediate concerns.<br/><br/>After the stand-up, I typically meet with Carlos to discuss budget updates or financial issues. <br/>His insights are crucial, though I occasionally need to guide the conversation to keep it from veering into <br/>overly pessimistic territory, which helps us stay focused on solutions rather than problems.<br/><br/>Mid-morning is usually reserved for one-on-one sessions with team members needing guidance. <br/>For instance, I often spend time with Fiona reviewing design timelines. <br/>She appreciates clear, empathetic feedback which I strive to provide, though I must balance this with the need to maintain our project schedule.<br/><br/>Lunch is a quick affair, often at my desk, as I catch up on emails and plan for the afternoon. <br/>Post-lunch, I review Leah's latest marketing initiatives or software developments. Leah's energy is infectious, <br/>though her ambition sometimes requires tempering to align with our practical deliverables.<br/><br/>My afternoons often involve strategic planning sessions, where I work with Josh <br/>to align our technology needs with business goals. <br/>His technical expertise is invaluable, though I sometimes mediate <br/>to ensure his ideas are clearly communicated to the rest of the team.<br/><br/>I end my day by updating our project management tools, responding to any final emails, <br/>and preparing the next day’s priority list. Before leaving, <br/>I always walk around to say a quick goodbye to the team, ensuring I leave on a personal note.<br/><br/>2. Negative Experience:<br/>A particularly challenging day occurred when we were nearing a major project deadline. <br/>Tensions were high, and despite my efforts to keep the team on track, a critical integration flaw was discovered. <br/>The error was in a section Josh had worked on; his usual calm demeanor made it difficult to gauge his concern, <br/>which initially seemed like disinterest. This misunderstanding escalated under pressure.<br/><br/>I felt overwhelmed and responsible, fearing the mistake would reflect poorly on my ability to manage. <br/>It was a stark reminder that my need for control and perfection could blind me to the team's stress levels. <br/>That day ended with us missing a deadline, a first for me, which deeply upset me.<br/><br/>3. Positive Experience:<br/>One of my proudest moments was leading the team during the launch of a new product that was pivotal to our company’s expansion. <br/>The project had complex components, requiring tight coordination between all departments. <br/>Despite the challenges, including balancing Carlos' cautious financial strategies <br/>with Leah's ambitious marketing plans, we executed a flawless launch.<br/><br/>The success was made sweeter by the positive feedback from upper management and the client’s satisfaction. <br/>It reinforced the value of my organizational skills and my ability to gently <br/>but effectively guide the team through high-pressure situations. <br/>That day, I truly felt accomplished, seeing the tangible results of our hard work and my leadership.</span></pre><p id="92b6" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mx my fq mz b go na nb nc gr nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns fj bk">The rest of the prompts and results can be found here: <a class="af ot" href="https://github.com/sugartrauma/llm-network-extraction/tree/main" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">llm-network-extraction/ at main · sugartrauma/llm-network-extraction (github.com)</a></p><p id="28af" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mx my fq mz b go na nb nc gr nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns fj bk"><strong class="mz fr">Extracting interactions</strong></p><p id="66b3" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mx my fq mz b go na nb nc gr nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns fj bk">Now that we have the input for our network analysis, we need to extract the relationships from the mentioned interactions.</p><pre class="ml mm mn mo mp oj ok ol bp om bb bk"><span id="a9ec" class="on oo fq ok b bg op oq l or os">You are a social network extraction tool.<br/>You are given an input marked in &lt;input&gt; tag.<br/><br/>Extract the relationships between people mentioned in the &lt;input&gt; text and <br/>structure them into a CSV format with columns: <br/>- source<br/>- target<br/>- edge_type<br/>- interaction_type<br/><br/>The relationships can be of two types: knowledge and personal. <br/>The interaction types for knowledge can be "gives knowledge" or "receives knowledge," <br/>For personal, the interaction_type can be "positive interaction" or "negative interaction."<br/><br/>Example input:<br/>&lt;input&gt;<br/>Josh helps Leah with coding challenges, sharing his expertise regularly. <br/>Emily and Fiona often collaborate creatively and have a positive working relationship.<br/>&lt;/input&gt;<br/><br/>Example output:<br/>source,target,edge_type,interaction_type<br/>Josh,Leah,knowledge,gives knowledge<br/>Emily,Fiona,personal,positive interaction<br/><br/>The relationship must be represented only once.<br/>You must not represent an edge in the opposite direction.<br/>Bad example:<br/>source,target,edge_type,interaction_type<br/>Josh,Leah,knowledge,gives knowledge<br/>Leah,Josh,knowledge,receives knowledge<br/><br/>Good example:<br/>source,target,edge_type,interaction_type<br/>Josh,Leah,knowledge,gives knowledge<br/><br/>&lt;input&gt;<br/>Input comes here<br/>&lt;/input&gt;</span></pre><p id="a7a6" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mx my fq mz b go na nb nc gr nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns fj bk">The LLM duplicated some relationships like:</p><p id="40d4" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mx my fq mz b go na nb nc gr nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns fj bk">Josh, Leah, knowledge, gives knowledge<br/>Leah, Josh, knowledge, receives knowledge</p><p id="942e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mx my fq mz b go na nb nc gr nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns fj bk">I deduplicated them and started the actual network analysis.</p><p id="1c30" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mx my fq mz b go na nb nc gr nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns fj bk">Although I’m fluent in Python, I wanted to showcase GPT4o’s capabilities for non-programmers too.
