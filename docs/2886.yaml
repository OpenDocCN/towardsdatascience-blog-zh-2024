- en: if the model had predicted a membership duration of 1,200 days for Member 1
    instead of 486 days, this would not affect the ranking. The model would still
    predict that Member 1 terminates their membership earlier than Member 2, regardless
    of the magnitude of the error in the prediction (i.e., the number of days). In
    survival analysis, any prediction for Member 1 that falls before the dotted line
    in the graph would maintain the same ranking, classifying this as a *concordant
    pair*. This concept is central to calculating the **C-index**, which measures
    the proportion of all pairs that are concordant in the dataset.

    time and the predicted event time, this is the absolute error. However, the ranking

    model predicts the termination of the membership before the actual event occurs.
    For Member 3, the actual membership duration is 528 days, but the model predicted
    termination 130 days earlier, namely 398 membership duration. Similarly, for Member
    4, the model anticipates the termination of membership before the actual event.
    In both cases, the model correctly ranks Member 4 to terminate their membership
    before Member 3.

    lower risk) directly drives actionable decisions and resource allocation. Absolute
    error in survival time predictions may not significantly affect the outcomes,

    models with high C-index can be highly effective, even when their absolute predictions
    are less precise.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In survival analysis, it is crucial to distinguish between **absolute error**
    and **ranking accuracy**. Absolute error refers to the difference between the
    predicted and actual event times, in this analysis measured in days. Metrics such
    as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are used to quantify
    the magnitude of these discrepancies hence measuring the overall predictive accuracy
    of the model. However, these metrics do not capture the model’s ability to correctly
    rank subjects by their likelihood of experiencing the event sooner or later.

- en: '**Ranking accuracy,** on the other hand evaluates how well the model orders
    subjects based on their predicted risk, regardless of the exact time prediction
    as illustrated above. This is where the **concordance index (C-index)** plays
    a key role. The C-index measures the model’s ability to correctly rank pairs of
    individuals, with higher values indicating better ranking accuracy. A C-index
    of 0.88 suggests that the model successfully ranks the risk of membership termination
    correctly 88% of the time.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Thus, while absolute error provides valuable insights into the precision of
    time predictions, the C-index focuses on the model’s ability to rank subjects
    correctly, which is often more important in survival analysis. A model with a
    high C-index can be highly effective in ranking individuals, even if it has some
    degree of absolute error, making it a powerful tool for predicting relative risks
    over time.
