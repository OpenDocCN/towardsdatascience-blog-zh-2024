- en: In real-world data science problems, high accuracy will be obtained simply because
    the dataset is extremely skewed and not because the algorithm performs well. You
    can have a dataset with a negative-to-positive class ratio of 1000:1 (like for
    spam classification), and this imbalance will lead to a high accuracy greater
    than 99% if we classify all points as negative. Hence, it matters to choose the
    right metric for evaluation, which is recall in this case. A high recall score
    would indicate that the positive classes are being‚Ä¶
