    goal perspective**, basic ideas have stayed the same in companies over time, any
    project that generates **increased sales** or **reduces costs** is always a good
    fit. Therefore, any AI initiative that demonstrates *(meaning evidence with measurable
    data)* the ability to drive efficiency, enable automation, or make predictions
    to accelerate decision-making processes would be a good place to start. From a
    **Use Case perspective**, it’s important to consider that **NOT everything needs
    to be solved with AI**, projects that can’t be addressed through traditional means,
    are data-rich, or involve large amounts of labor are likely to be well received.
    Finally, don’t forget that **early executive buy-in is important**; a **strong
    endorsement** can be the difference between reaching the deployment stage or getting
    stuck in the middle of the journey.

    with AI, aim for **incremental benefits** by using what has already been proven

    use. It goes both ways, if you intend to utilize a specific technology, ensure
    that your team has the appropriate skills to manage it or the ability to learn
    it quickly. Technical skills can be found in the labor market *(depending on the
    technical skills required, they may come at a price)* or developed internally,

    and a steady stream of income, **Evolutionary AI initiatives** to replicate successful
    deployments in other markets, and **Disruptive AI** initiatives to remain at the
    forefront and anticipate future trends. The portfolio-mix depends on the tolerance
    for waiting for early wins. AI is not a solitary endeavor; it involves managing
    a portfolio of AI initiatives. The key is to continually expand the funnel and
    shorten the testing process so that AI initiatives can be tested and deployed
    quickly at low cost.*(For further insights on managing an innovation portfolio,
