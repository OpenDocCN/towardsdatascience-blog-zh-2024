    for several years now, providing practitioners with the data they need for their
    projects in situations where real-world datasets prove inaccessible, unavailable,
    or limited from a copyright or approved-use perspective.'

- en: The recent rise of LLMs and AI-generated tools has transformed the synthetic-data
    scene, however, just as it has numerous other workflows for machine learning and
    data science professionals. This week, we’re presenting a collection of recent
    articles that cover the latest trends and possibilities you should be aware of,
    as well as the questions and considerations you should keep in mind if you decide
    to create your own toy dataset from scratch. Let’s dive in!

    it’s been a while since the last time you found yourself in need of synthetic
    data, don’t miss [Mia Dwyer](https://medium.com/u/110567c9c334?source=post_page---user_mention--04d8582b6f88--------------------------------)’s
    concise tutorial, which outlines a streamlined method for creating a dummy dataset
    with GPT-4 and a little bit of Python. Mia keeps things fairly simple, and you
    can adapt and build on this approach so it fits your specific needs.'

    we recommend catching up with [Vincent Koc](https://medium.com/u/79191c4a8149?source=post_page---user_mention--04d8582b6f88--------------------------------)’s
    guide to synthetic user research. It leverages an architecture of autonomous agents
    to “create and interact with digital customer personas in simulated research scenarios,”
    making user research both more accessible and less resource-heavy.'

    [Tea Mustać](https://medium.com/u/109d4928877a?source=post_page---user_mention--04d8582b6f88--------------------------------)
    focuses on a promising use case—training AI products, which often requires massive

    looks at the different ways that simulated data can empower us to make better
    business and policy decisions and draw powerful insights along the way. After
    covering model testing and power analysis in previous articles, the latest installment
    zooms in on the possibility of simulating more complex scenarios for optimized
