    case that data follows a graph structure, take for example social networks, protein
    structures, recommendation or transportation systems. Leaving the information
    about the graph topology out of a machine learning model can decrease the performance
    drastically. Luckily, there is a way to include this information.**'

- en: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are designed to learn from data represented as
    nodes and edges. GNNs have evolved over the years, and in this post you will learn
    about Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). My next post will cover Graph Attention
    Networks (GATs). GCNs and GATs are two fundamental architectures on which current
    state of the art models are based upon, so if you want to learn about GNNs, this
    is a good start. Let’s dive in!

    post (Graph Basics) explains the basics of graphs. Also, you should be familiar
    with [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network_(machine_learning))
    (a short recap is provided in this article, in the part Datasets and Prerequisites).
