    and account security at the bustling London office. Now, as I look back, I find
    myself continually drawn to the invaluable lessons gleaned during my time there.
    Beyond the confines of the office, these insights have seamlessly integrated into
    both my professional and personal growth.

    undergo rigorous assessments based on how much tangible impact they’ve made in
    the last 6 months. The focus isn’t solely on tasks completed or volumes achieved;
    rather, it’s about the consequential outcomes stemming from one’s actions.
