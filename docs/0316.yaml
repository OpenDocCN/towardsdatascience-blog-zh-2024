- en: Memory is essential for our existence and identity. The goal of learning is
    to have the memory stored in the brain for rapid or intuitive retrievals as needed.
    It applies to everything we do in everyday life, such as skills, habits, reasoning,
    social interactions, and decision-making. While we constantly learn since birth,
    many wish we could have learned faster and remembered more. In reality, we complain
    frequently about forgetting, whereas, sometimes, we cannot remove the bad memories
    we want to forget. As we grow older, dementia becomes one of the top concerns
    that may affect our lives and those around us.

- en: While artificial intelligence (AI) has taken inspiration from human brains and
    made remarkable advances in deep learning, one challenge artificial neural networks
    (ANNs) have experienced is catastrophic forgetting, where the network encounters
    a sudden and drastic performance drop in previously mastered tasks when learning
    new information. Catastrophic forgetting typically happens when an ANN is trained
    to learn multiple tasks sequentially. However, humans can learn large numbers
    of tasks throughout their lifetime without forgetting those previously learned.
