    mechanism works immediately stood out. Indeed, when launching a new series, starting
    with the fundamentals is a wise strategy, and Large Language Models (LLMs) are
    the talk of the town.

    mechanics, its efficacy, and its applications. So, if I want to keep you from
    snoozing before we even start, I have to find a unique perspective.

    to mitigate some of them.

    and memory-efficient exact Attention with IO-awareness. This description might
    seem overwhelming at first, but I’m confident everything will become clear by
    the end.'
