Yet many of the central ideas in physics arise from simpler principles that have been tweaked and modified into increasingly complex formalisms that better map physical phenomena.</p><p id="ca54" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fq ng b go nh ni nj gr nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz fj bk">While many <a class="af nd" rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="/how-to-transition-from-physics-to-data-science-a-comprehensive-guide-ff1951090f65">physics graduates end up working in data science</a>, can mathematical insights in physics inform and enrich the data scientist? I argue yes. Even though data science as a distinct discipline is relativity new, the collection and analysis of data pervades the history of physics such as the collection of astronomical observation by Johannes Kepler from which he derived his laws of planetary motion. Both physics and data science extract patterns from data, though typically data science deals with statistical patterns while physics with lawful or nomological patterns. Having an understanding of fundamental laws can help data scientists with modelling complex systems and develop simulations of real-world phenomena.</p><p id="45f1" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fq ng b go nh ni nj gr nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz fj bk">In my own work, maintaining a strong interest in physics has helped me make important connections between information theory and statistical mechanics. Further, it has helped me understand the flexibility of mathematics, in particular linear algebra and calculus, in modelling physical systems constrained by spatial dimensions and more abstract multidimensional systems that include social and stochastic patterns. Moreover, it can be inspiring as well as intellectually gratifying to understand the rudiments of how physics models the world around us and how the incremental improvements of physics have required molding the math to fit and predict the data that nature supplies.</p><p id="2988" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fq ng b go nh ni nj gr nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz fj bk">In this article, I odyssey through three mathematical ideas that underpin much of physics: the stationary action principle (also known as the principle of least action), Lorentz transformations, which describe time and space transformations in Einstein’s special theory of relativity, and the metric tensor, which underlies the math of General Relativity (the theory of gravity as spacetime curvature).</p><p id="e8fe" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fq ng b go nh ni nj gr nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz fj bk">The Stationary Action principle is perhaps the most important in all of physics because it threads through classical and quantum mechanics. It forms an alternative though equivalent formulation to the classical equations of motion invented by Newton for describing the evolution of a physical system. Specifically, it describes the motion of a physical system in time by determining the path that minimizes something called <em class="oa">the action</em>. The action is a functional, namely a function that takes functions as inputs, that describes the path of the system as stationary with respect to path variations between two points. Understanding the action as a functional, specifically as scoring the path variations, is key to understanding the concept behind it. The specifics of this will become clearer in the exposition below. This remarkable result articulates motion as a type of optimization function within given constraints.</p><p id="7b56" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fq ng b go nh ni nj gr nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz fj bk">Lorentz Transformations describe how the coordinates of time and space are intertwined into a unified metric that enables their measurements to proportionally change relative to observers in inertial frames of reference while conserving the speed of light. This formalism ensures that the speed of light remains constant across frames of reference, contrary to Newtonian assumptions that would have the speed of light change against invariable units of space and time. Before the theory of special relativity, the constancy of the speed of light was an experimentally observed phenomenon that did not fit into the framework of classical physics.</p><p id="1924" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fq ng b go nh ni nj gr nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz fj bk">Finally, we explain the mathematical ideas behind the metric tensor, which describes length or distance in curved spaces. The metric tensor is a bilinear, symmetric identity matrix that generalizes the Pythagorean theorem underlying flat, Euclidean space to any possible space including curved surfaces. Curved surfaces were used by Einstein to describe the distortion of spacetime in the presence of gravity. As data scientists, you’re likely very familiar with the Euclidean distance and linear algebra so appreciating the concepts behind the metric tensor should be a natural step. The metric tensor developed by Bernhard Riemann forms the foundation of non-Euclidean geometry and remarkably generalizes the notion of <em class="oa">length</em> to any underlying geometry.</p><h1 id="2582" class="ob oc fq bf od oe of gq og oh oi gt oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou ov ow bk">Principle of Least Action</h1><p id="c399" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fq ng b go ox ni nj gr oy nl nm nn oz np nq nr pa nt nu nv pb nx ny nz fj bk">The <em class="oa">Principle of Least Action</em> or the <em class="oa">Stationary Action Principle </em>constitutes the centrepiece of physics.

In contrast to the Newtonian method, the principle of least action computes the trajectory of the system by taking in the initial and final positions, masses and velocities (and other constraints depending on the system) but omits forces. It subsequently selects the path that minimizes a quantity called the <em class="oa">action</em>. Before we explain exactly what the action consists in, we need to understand an alternative formulation to Newton’s equations called the <em class="oa">Lagrangian</em>.</p><p id="c0d2" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fq ng b go nh ni nj gr nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz fj bk">The <strong class="ng fr">Lagrangian<em class="oa"> L</em></strong> is computed as the difference between Kinetic energy <strong class="ng fr"><em class="oa">T</em> </strong>and potential energy <strong class="ng fr"><em class="oa">V</em></strong>, where <strong class="ng fr"><em class="oa">T</em></strong> is given by the product of mass and velocity squared divided by 2 (2 denoting the average between initial velocity and final velocity), and <strong class="ng fr"><em class="oa">V</em></strong> by the product of the mass of the object <strong class="ng fr"><em class="oa">m</em></strong>, the gravitational constant <strong class="ng fr"><em class="oa">g</em> </strong>and the height of the object above ground <strong class="ng fr"><em class="oa">h </em></strong>(the computation of potential energy varies with the system).</p><figure class="mn mo mp mq mr ms mk ml paragraph-image"><div class="mk ml pc"><img src="../Images/82472f95bfee8e524b95afda7ba747c5.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*EBUNzUkmBS8M5dUK7xjGFA.png"/></div></figure><p id="4211" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fq ng b go nh ni nj gr nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz fj bk">Why is the Lagrangian computed as the difference between kinetic and potential energy?

However, since the matrix is necessarily symmetric, only 10 of these components are independent of each other.</p><p id="2ddb" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fq ng b go nh ni nj gr nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz fj bk">The generic form of the metric tensor is show below:</p><figure class="mn mo mp mq mr ms mk ml paragraph-image"><div class="mk ml rd"><img src="../Images/d503c1c05881e97b086133898bfa2fe3.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:568/format:webp/1*xN0Du1nqNSVM0rqcUfmxNg.png"/></div></figure><p id="3be6" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fq ng b go nh ni nj gr nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz fj bk">The values of the metric tensor change with the curvature of spacetime as they encode the mass-energy distribution. Therefore, unlike Euclidean distance that conserves length across all transformations, curved geometry does not. This is why the metric tensor is a crucial aspect of understanding general relativity.</p><p id="eab3" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fq ng b go nh ni nj gr nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz fj bk">Now that you’ve surveyed through these concepts, you may be less daunted by complex ideas and mathematical formalists in physics!</p><h1 id="2a1c" class="ob oc fq bf od oe of gq og oh oi gt oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou ov ow bk">Sources</h1><p id="e255" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fq ng b go ox ni nj gr oy nl nm nn oz np nq nr pa nt nu nv pb nx ny nz fj bk">Susskind, Leonard, and George Hrabovsky. <em class="oa">The Theoretical Minimum: What You Need to Know to Start Doing Physics</em>.
