    AI tools to support coding has grown quickly. Large Language Models, like ChatGPT,
    are incredibly powerful to help us with code. Coding relies on a “language” with
    clear syntax, which makes it an ideal domain for LLMs.

    the most time doing. Historically, if you didn’t understand the error, you would
    refer to manuals, copy and paste the error message, and search online (e.g. Stack
    Overflow) for solutions. More recently, you might even ask ChatGPT or another
    LLM for help.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But now there’s an incredibly fast integrated solution. As you can see in the
    video below, I ran some code that generated an error. After each error message,
    you’ll see a button labeled “Explain error.” Once you click it, a pane will open
    on the right-hand side, and Gemini (an LLM) will explain the error and propose
    adjusted code. You can then adapt the code by hand, copy-paste the suggestion,
    or in one click, create a new cell with the corrected code in your notebook.

    based on your description.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first way is by writing a comment (see the video below). I just write a
    comment that explains the next line of code, and Colab directly interprets it
    and automatically suggests the corresponding code. This functionality works mainly
    for simple, usually single lines of code.

    lines of code, you can click on “Generate” with AI when you start a new code block
    (see video below). Then, you can use natural language to explain what you want
    to do, and the code will be automatically generated. Note that the prompt will
    be included as a comment on top, so try to make a clear request to save time.

    be used in moderation when learning. This efficiency might prevent us from truly
    mastering the material and could negatively affect our long-term performance.
  prefs:

    writing less and less code — it’s more about being able to read and test code
    now. But reading is always easier than writing, just like when learning any language
    (not just programming).
  prefs: []

- en: However, this raises questions about the long-term effects for people who haven’t
    yet fully learned how to code. I remember using these tools extensively to select
    parts of Pandas dataframes because I often mixed up the brackets, `.loc` or `.iloc`
    functions, and syntax. ChatGPT helped me go faster a few times, but over the long
    run, I became less efficient. If I have to ask every time, it often takes longer
    than if I knew the solution by heart. And what happens if the tool isn't available?

    Always aim to understand the code you’re incorporating to avoid potential issues
    with plagiarism or unintended errors. Note that when using suggestions in Google
    Colab, you might see the source of the code inspiration (see image below). This
    information can help you avoid potential copyright violations.
