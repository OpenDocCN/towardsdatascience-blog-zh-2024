    models being proposed and claiming state-of-the-art performance.

    on large datasets with many features.

- en: Although numerous models have been proposed in recent years, such as the [iTransformer](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/itransformer-the-latest-breakthrough-in-time-series-forecasting-d538ddc6c5d1),
    [SOFTS](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/softs-the-latest-innovation-in-time-series-forecasting-dbc82553dd76),
    and [TimesNet](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/timesnet-the-latest-advance-in-time-series-forecasting-745b69068c9c),
    their performance often falls short in other benchmarks against models like [NHITS](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/all-about-n-hits-the-latest-breakthrough-in-time-series-forecasting-a8ddcb27b0d5),
    [PatchTST](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/patchtst-a-breakthrough-in-time-series-forecasting-e02d48869ccc)
    and [TSMixer](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/patchtst-a-breakthrough-in-time-series-forecasting-e02d48869ccc).

    paper, [TimeMixer: Decomposable Multiscale Mixing for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14616),
    this model uses mixing of features along with series decomposition in an MLP-based
    architecture to produce forecasts.'

    our own little benchmark in both short and long horizon forecasting tasks.
