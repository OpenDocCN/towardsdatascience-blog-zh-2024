is famous for his speech, <strong class="nf fr">“</strong><a class="af nc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Have_a_Dream" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">I Have a Dream</a>.<strong class="nf fr">”</strong> He delivered it at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., on August 28, 1963, in front of approximately 250,000 persons. It’s considered one of the most important speeches of the 20th century. It played a crucial role in the civil rights movement for Black Americans.</p><p id="d16c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">During this speech, he said that he dreamed of a day when his four children would live in a nation where people will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.</p><p id="a27c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">I also had a dream several years ago. It was not as glorious or reshaped the course of history as Martin Luther King's. I aspired to become a data scientist.</p><p id="c49e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">It wasn’t for the prestige or because it was trendy (and still is) but because I genuinely love working with data, solving complex problems, and leveraging insights to drive business results. Becoming a data scientist was where my unique skills and passions met. You know, that <a class="af nc" href="https://medium.com/towards-data-science/the-one-mindset-change-that-launched-me-into-data-science-3f72bd1df46f" rel="noopener">sweet spot that leads to a fulfilling career</a>.</p><p id="be67" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">My journey wasn’t straightforward. I didn’t know where to start, nor did I know what to do next. I took various courses, many of which turned out to be unhelpful. I also read countless articles about data science. While becoming a data scientist requires hard work, I spent a lot of effort on things that ultimately weren’t necessary.</p><p id="dbbf" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">I wish someone had given me the guidance I’m about to share with you. This is the purpose of this article. The good news? Following these steps won’t guarantee a job as a data scientist, but they will significantly improve your chances… even without a PhD! I know several professionals who have excelled as data scientists without doctorates. Success in this field is mainly about persistence and practical experience.</p><h1 id="eca0" class="nz oa fq bf ob oc od gq oe of og gt oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou bk">Start Somewhere, Start Now</h1><blockquote class="ov ow ox"><p id="20c8" class="nd ne oy nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">“<a class="af nc" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Plato" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">The beginning is the most important part of any work</a>.”</p><p id="6e25" class="nd ne oy nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">— Plato</p></blockquote><p id="4dcf" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk"><a class="af nc" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3591461/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Research shows</a> that a toddler takes about 14,000 steps and experiences 100 falls per day over 2–3 months before mastering walking.

We tend to abandon as soon as we encounter obstacles. Where an adult might see 100 failures, a baby sees 100 learning opportunities. The baby doesn’t overanalyze its failure or overcalculate the risks. It simply starts, tries, falls, and tries again!</p><p id="35cc" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Consider the story of Justin Kan, the co-founder of Twitch. His entrepreneurial journey didn’t start with a blockbuster success. It began with what he called a “<a class="af nc" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/justinkan_shitty-first-startups-activity-6870154231052025856-gzFV/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">shitty first startup</a>” named Kiko, an online calendar app. Kiko was competing against giants like Google Calendar, but it was eventually sold on eBay for $258,100!</p><p id="4fd6" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Next, he launched Justin.tv, a platform where he live-streamed his life 24/7. Justin.tv eventually became Twitch, a live-streaming platform focused on gaming. In 2014, Amazon acquired Twitch for $970 million!</p><p id="886c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">As Justin Kan stated, “<a class="af nc" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/justinkan_shitty-first-startups-activity-6870154231052025856-gzFV/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Don’t wait. Go build your first shitty startup now.</a>”</p><p id="15ef" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">This advice applies to your journey into data science as well. Start somewhere. Begin your learning process now. Even if your first attempt feels “shitty” and you’re unsure of where to start, it’s okay. You can build upon your initial efforts, and nothing prevents you from adjusting your direction as you progress.

However, here’s the truth. The best AI model will have a 0$ value if it doesn’t solve a business problem.

One of the concepts he is known for is the Pareto optimality.

In quality control, 80% of problems are caused by 20% of defects. In the workplace, 20% of our tasks contribute to 80% of what we deliver. We tend to use about 20% of what we own 80%. And the list goes on.</p><p id="81c2" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">The same idea applies to your journey of becoming a data scientist. Instead of trying to master every possible topic, focus on taking just one course for each key area: mathematics for data science, Python, SQL, machine learning, and business analytics. That’s it. Focus on the core 20% of skills (or even less), yielding 80% of your results.</p><p id="30bd" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Remember, don’t get caught in the trap of “tutorial hell,” where you constantly consume new content but never deeply understand what you’re learning.
