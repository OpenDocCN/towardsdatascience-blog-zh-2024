    started working as a data scientist in September 2021, so it took me about 2 and
    a half years in total to get the promotion.

- en: So, from September 2017 to July 2021, I studied and graduated with a master’s
    in Physics. During my final year, I realised that physics research was not for
    me, so I decided to become a data scientist after watching the [AlphaGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo)
    documentary (amazing, you should check it out if haven’t watched it!).
