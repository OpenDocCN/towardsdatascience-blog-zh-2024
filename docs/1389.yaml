    / 1000” for an ads-based business) and then break each part down further to get
    to the underlying drivers. The exact revenue equation depends on the type of business
    you’re working on; you can find some of the most common ones [here](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/the-math-formula-behind-your-business).

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    insights from what is mostly noise.

    you’re able to **act on the data**:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Real-time data is useful for a B2C marketplace like Uber because **1)** transactions
    have a short lifecycle (an Uber ride is typically requested, accepted and completed
    within less than an hour) ***and 2) because Uber has the tools to respond in real-time***
    (e.g. surge pricing, incentives, driver comms).
  prefs:

    less actionable due to long deal cycles.

    against the metric. If your partner teams have monthly goals, then the default
    view for these metrics should be monthly.

  prefs:

    into context.
  prefs: []

    improving or deteriorating? Of course, it’s even better if you have an idea of
    the exact level you want the metric to be at.'
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you have an ***official goal*** set against the metric, great. But even if
    you don’t, you can still figure out whether you’re on track or not by deriving
    ***implied goals***.
  prefs:

    an official goal for how much pipeline they need to generate to hit quota.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this case, you can look at the historical ratio of open pipeline to quota
    (“Pipeline Coverage”), and use this as your benchmark. **Be aware:** By doing
    this, you are implicitly assuming that performance will remain steady (in this
    case, that the team is converting pipeline to revenue at a steady rate).

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    correctly. In other words, does the metric you’re looking at have repeating patterns

    the current month (April). It’s the 15th business day of the month and you brought

    team is going to miss since you only have 6 business days left.*'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most straightforward way is to cut aggregate metrics by time period (e.g.
    first week conversion, second week conversion etc.). This allows you to get an
    early read while making the comparison apples-to-apples and avoiding a bias towards
    older cohorts.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This way, you can see that on an apples-to-apples basis, our conversion rate
    is getting worse (our week-1 CVR dropped from > 20% to c. 15% in recent cohorts).
    By just looking at the aggregate conversion rate (the last column) we wouldn’t
    have been able to distinguish an actual drop from incomplete data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In some cases, you can change the definition of the metric to avoid looking
    at incomplete data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, instead of looking at how many deals that entered the pipeline
    in March closed until now, you could look at how many of the deals that closed
    in March were won vs. lost. This number will not change over time, while you might
    have to wait months for the final performance of the March deal cohort.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Based on past data, you can project where the final performance of a cohort
    will likely end up. The more time passes and the more actual data you gather,
    the more the forecast will converge to the actual value.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**But be careful:** Forecasting cohort performance should be approached carefully
    as it’s easy to get this wrong. E.g. if you’re working in a B2B business with
    low win rates, a single deal might meaningfully change the performance of a cohort.
    Forecasting this accurately is very difficult.'

    this data, the team can either try to reignite growth in high-CPM regions, think
    about additional monetization options for APAC, or focus on making up the lower
    value of individual impressions through outsized growth in impressions volume
    in the large APAC market.
