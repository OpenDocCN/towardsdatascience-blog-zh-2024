  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Those who consider the best agent to be ‚ÄúCL103.‚Äù** This interpretation is
    based on the absolute number of sales or revenue (360 total sales). And while
    estimating sales performance by revenue is what intuition first tells us, this
    way of measuring is biased. The problem is that this agent has managed a larger
    number of leads. Therefore, having had access to more potential customers and
    having worked more, he has undoubtedly had more opportunities than the others,
    and thus, it is normal that he has converted more.'
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Those who consider the best agent to be ‚ÄúAG101.‚Äù** This interpretation is
    based on conversion rate (5.7%). In this case, the previous bias is normalized.
    Conversion rate compares the agents‚Äô ability to generate sales, regardless of
    the number of leads each agent has received. In other words, it evaluates the
    transformation of leads into sales, regardless of the initial absolute number
    of leads, providing a more equitable view of each agent‚Äôs performance. However,
    as we see, agent ‚ÄúAG101‚Äù has provided less absolute sales. Sometimes, agents with
    a less volume of leads can focus on converting them and provide better service,
    but in that case, the owner AG101 has the aproximately the same volume as MJ105
    or IG105, and significantly overperforms them.'

    Performance Ratio of Best Leads), as we assumed in the hypothesis.

    performance ratio on the best leads (-28.8%) suggests that AG101 may not be leveraging
    the best leads as effectively as expected. This could indicate that AG101 could
    be speciallized on some sort of leads, but not necessarily the best ones.
