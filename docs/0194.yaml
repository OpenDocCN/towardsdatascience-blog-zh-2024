    are data-driven and -literate. They want to use data to optimize their campaigns
    and achieve their ROI targets.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Dashboards lack the granularity and flexibility for deep dives (e.g., keyword-
    or creative-level analysis) and are not well suited for specific marketing analyses
    like budgeting or pacing. Moreover, marketing is very fast-changing. Analytics
    needs change very quickly (e.g., new channel, new metric, new dimension).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Marketers depend on data teams for any updates such as changes to metrics or
    dimensions. Report requests wait for data teams’ prioritization, which takes too
    long.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    — the stakes are high.

    which meet the needs of managers, directors, and VPs. Daily and weekly operational
    decisions require more granularity and flexibility. This is why “self-service”
    dashboards break for operational use cases, typically owned by individual contributors
    like performance marketing managers and user acquisition managers.

- en: In the early days of any company, marketing analytics runs on spreadsheets.
    As the data team builds the modern data stack, the expectation is that spreadsheets
    will go away. And they often do for some time. However, at a later stage, when
    the company continues to grow, expand into new channels and markets, launch more
    campaigns, etc., there is a need for more granular analysis at the speed of business.
    That’s where spreadsheets come back.

    from channel platforms or using connectors tools, modeling the data, and running
    analyses. These manual processes and workflows are very time-consuming and error-prone.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    silos, and mess. The common symptom is the typical question “Why don’t the numbers
    match?”

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Closing this gap often requires work across the 4 key elements (culture, people,
    tools, processes). Where to start and what to prioritize depends on your current
    situation. That’s where you should start: deeply understand how your marketers
    are running their analysis. Don’t just ask them. Instead, sit next to them and
    let them walk you through their daily and weekly workflows. This will enable you
    to understand where to start and map out the gap between your current situation
    and the ideal world.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data teams are sometimes bothered by this situation or simply ignore it. This
    is not the way to solve this problem. Avoid getting emotionally attached to the
    dashboards and solutions you‘ve built. Also, avoid simplistic explanations like
    “marketers don’t know how to use our BI tool. That’s why they use spreadsheets”.
    These pitfalls lead to interpersonal friction, making the problem worse.
  prefs: []

    team. See this gap as a big opportunity to have a significant business impact
    and improve the ROI of data.

    operational workflows. You should map out which needs can be covered by your dashboards
    and which use cases need more flexible and granular solutions. Ideally, you should
    aim to build or buy a comprehensive solution that combines the flexibility of
    spreadsheets with the scale and governance of BI solutions.'

    team over giving up (i.e., the typical answer — “they don’t know how to use our
    BI tool”). Challenge existing assumptions and seek to understand why. Present
    a solid business case to tackle this opportunity and get executive buy-in.'

- en: '**Processes**: Develop best practices around ideal workflows (e.g., “What’s
    the best way to perform a keyword analysis). Also, ensure regular touchpoints
    with marketers to collect their feedback and align on what to work next. You should
    combine qualitative feedback (i.e., regular touch points) with quantitative approaches
    (e.g., quarterly surveys).'
