- en: During the past five years, I’ve served as the VP of Data Science, AI, and Research
    at two publicly traded companies. In both roles, AI was central to the company’s
    core product. This provided significant resources and the opportunity to lead
    substantial departments — comprising 40–50 data scientists, including 2–3 group
    leaders and 6–8 team leads. One of the greatest challenges in this role has been
    structuring the department to enhance effectiveness, streamline value, and clarify
    roles and responsibilities. Today, I’ll share some best practices I’ve gathered
    through six departmental reorganizations.

- en: Your guiding principle throughout the process should be the business need. What
    value is your organization creating? Are you developing models for a core product,
    or supporting the business with internal ML solutions? Identify the specific value
    your department provides and the key performance indicators (KPIs) used to measure
    success. Ideally, you should have explicit KPIs, but if these are unavailable,
    develop implicit measures to guide your efforts (i.e. how are you measuring yourself).
