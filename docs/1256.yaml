    between business intelligence, software engineering, machine learning, data analysis,
    and product. On top of that, all companies use data scientists differently, and
    their respective interviews reflect that by spanning a wide array of questions
    and processes. We data scientists must be prepared to answer questions on statistics,
    machine learning, a/b testing, business intelligence, system design, leetcode
    style programming questions, ML Ops, and more.
