- en: Streamlit is a widely used tool for creating quick web applications backed by
    data, but one of the capabilities it does not have is the ability to manage multiple
    users and identify them while they use the app.

- en: Streamlit has some basic [documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/knowledge-base/deploy/authentication-without-sso)
    on how you can add this by using hard coded key-value pairs in your `secrets.toml`
    file, however this is a really simplistic method and you'll probably outgrow it
    quickly!

- en: Fortunately, developer Mohammad Khorasani wrote an excellent package that adds
    pretty sophisticated authentication in a very simple and elegant way! It’s called
    [Streamlit Authenticator](https://github.com/mkhorasani/Streamlit-Authenticator)
    and is available on GitHub and can be installed with your favorite package manager,
    such as PIP.

- en: Mohammad supplies a nice [sample application](https://demo-app-v0-3-3.streamlit.app/)
    and code for a single-page application, but there is not one for a multi-page
    application. I decided to make a starting point for anyone that is interested
    in using it. I also [checked](https://github.com/mkhorasani/Streamlit-Authenticator-demo/issues/1)
    with the author to make sure the code was correct.
