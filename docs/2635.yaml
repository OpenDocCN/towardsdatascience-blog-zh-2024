- en: The truth is that the difference between getting noticed or not by recruiters
    often lies in how you position yourself on LinkedIn and how you prepare for the
    recruitment process. In this article, I share some of the lessons I’ve learned
    over the past few years, which led me to be invited to interviews at companies
    like Mercado Livre, Amazon, Meta, TikTok, and Uber, among others.

    visible on LinkedIn. I started posting more regularly, at least every couple of
    weeks, sharing my stories and engaging with other people’s posts. Here are some
    key tips for that.

    ambitions. Keep your profile updated and relevant to the area you want to work
    in. This [article](https://medium.com/@robson.tigre0/dicas-sobre-busca-ativa-e-linkedin-para-mudar-de-carreira-ou-encontrar-novas-vagas-7bb90b4d74df)
    has some tips on how to give your profile an upgrade (PT-BR version only, but
    the figures are self explanatory).'

    got (i.e., when recruiters approached me) came after I started creating more content
    on LinkedIn. And it doesn’t have to be overly complicated. For example, I write
    articles like this one about my experiences and publish them directly on LinkedIn
    as “Individual Articles.” This will help increase your engagement and avoid the
    drop in visibility that occurs when sharing external links (like Medium, YouTube,
    etc.).'

    be from your field. Provide intuitive explanations, starting with the basics and

    to understand the campaign’s effect. I modeled the problem using ‘difference in

    aspect of your experiences, providing clarity and depth in your response. Ideally,
    have 3–4 examples structured with STAR for different types of interview questions.
