    because they differ significantly from software engineering. Since we aim to discover
    patterns in data without explicitly coding them, there is more uncertainty involved,
    which can lead to various issues such as:'

    it comes to large-scale projects — that normally have higher expectations attached
    to them — these setbacks can be amplified and have catastrophic consequences for
    organizations and teams.

    projects with [DareData](https://www.daredata.ai/). I’ve had the opportunity to
    manage diverse projects across various industries, collaborating with talented
    teams who’ve contributed to my growth and success along the way — its thanks to
    them that I could gather these tips and lay them out in writing.
