- en: Three and a half years ago, when I wrote “[All databases are multi-model](https://victormorgante.medium.com/all-databases-are-multi-model-169ce22e4593)”
    I was taking a real stab in the dark. I had just started FactEngine and had a
    vision that every database could be seen as a graph database and relational database…a
    multi-model database. A few multi-model databases existed already, and large names
    like SQL Server had already started to venture into the multi-model world.

    just released a new standard, [ISO/IEC 39075:2024](https://www.iso.org/standard/76120.html)
    — Information technology — Database languages — GQL…and where GQL stands for Graph
    Query Language, and where the standard has been designed to equally be an overlay
    over existing relational databases as it is a standard for future graph databases.
    Multi-model goes mainstream.

    much as the standard itself.
