    in 1736\. Now known as Kaliningrad, Russia, this thriving port is a cultural and
    architectural marvel. As you meander along the banks of the Pregel River, a vital
    artery of the city, you’re greeted by the lively chatter of marketplaces and the
    distant hum of merchant ships. Seven magnificent bridges arc over the river, connecting
    the various islands and neighborhoods. Little do you know that the path you walk
    has become the basis of a mathematical riddle that is vexing some of the sharpest
    minds of the continent.

    Is it possible to traverse this city while crossing each bridge exactly once?'
