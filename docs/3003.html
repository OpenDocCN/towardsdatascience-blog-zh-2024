Since deep-learning embeddings have proven so powerful, they’ve also become the default: pick a model, embed your data, pick a metric, do some RAG. To add new value, it helps to have a different take on crunching language. <br/>The one I’ll share today started years ago, with a single book.</p><p id="7e4b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk"><em class="nf">The Orchid Thief </em>is both non-fiction and full of mischief. I had first read it in my 20s, skipping most of the historical anecdata, itching for its first-person accounts. At the time, I laughed out loud but turned the pages in quiet fury, that someone could live so deeply and write so well. I wasn’t all that sure these were different things.</p><p id="e7af" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">Within a year I had moved to London to start anew. <br/>I went into financial services, which is like a theme park for nerds. And, for the ensuing decade, would only take jobs with lots of writing.</p><p id="82c7" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">Lots being the operative word.</p><p id="d2a5" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">Behind the modern façade of professional services, British industry is alive to its old factories and shipyards. It employs Alice to do a thing, and then hand it over to Bob; he turns some screws, and it’s on to Charlie. One month on, we all do it again. As a newcomer, I noticed habits weren’t so much a ditch to fall into, but a mound to stake.</p><p id="6f56" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">I was also reading lots. Okay, I was reading the <em class="nf">New Yorker</em>. My most favourite thing was to flip a fresh one on its cover, open it from the back, and read the opening sentences of one, Anthony Lane, who writes film reviews. Years and years, not once did I go see a movie.</p><p id="e14c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">Every now and again, a flicker would catch me off-guard. A barely-there thread between the <em class="nf">New Yorker </em>corpus and my non-Pulitzer outputs. In both corpora, each piece was different to its siblings, but also…<em class="nf">not quite. </em>Similarities echoed. And I knew the ones in my work had arisen out of a repetitive process.</p><p id="1d04" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">In 2017 I began meditating on the threshold separating writing that <em class="nf">feels formulaic</em> from one that can be explicitly written out <em class="nf">as a formula</em>.</p><p id="e07f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">The argument goes like this: volume of repetition hints at a (typically tacit) form of algorithmic decision-making. But procedural repetition leaves fingerprints.

In 1964, statisticians Frederick Mosteller and David Wallace landed on the cover of <em class="nf">Time</em> magazine, their forensic literary analysis <a class="af pa" href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/cslipublications/cslipublications/site/1575865521.shtml" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">settling a 140-year old debate</a> over the authorship of a famed dozen of anonymously-written essays.</p><p id="af41" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">But forensic analytics always looks at the single item in relation to two corpora: the one created by the suspected author, and the null hypothesis. Comparative analytics only cares about comparing bodies of text.</p><figure class="nj nk nl nm nn no ng nh paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="np nq ed nr bh ns"><div class="ng nh pb"><img src="../Images/5afa6ddc65ea2a963edd4178746798c5.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*dbtq5FGuzlI6hWF5p29rpQ.png"/></div></div><figcaption class="nu nv nw ng nh nx ny bf b bg z dx">Image by author</figcaption></figure><h2 id="558d" class="nz oa fq bf ob oc od oe of og oh oi oj ms ok ol om mw on oo op na oq or os ot bk"><strong class="al">Building A Text Analytics Engine</strong></h2><p id="f417" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go ou mn mo gr ov mq mr ms ow mu mv mw ox my mz na oy nc nd ne fj bk">Let’s retrace our steps: given a corpus, we applied the same function on each of the texts (the readability function). This mapped the corpus onto a set (in this case, numbers). On this set we applied another function (the histogram). Finally, we did it to two different corpora — and compared the results.</p><p id="20a7" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">If you squint, you’ll see I’ve just described Excel.</p><p id="ea72" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">What looks like a table is actually <strong class="ml fr">a <em class="nf">pipeline</em></strong><em class="nf">, </em>crunching columns sequentially.

I wanted to apply functions like <code class="cx pc pd pe pf b">Count Verbs</code> or <code class="cx pc pd pe pf b">First Paragraph Subject</code>or <code class="cx pc pd pe pf b">First Important Sentence</code>. And it had to be flexible enough so I could ask <em class="nf">any question</em>; who knows what would end up mattering?</p><p id="c20c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">In 2020 this kind of solution did not exist, so I built it. And boy did this software not ‘practically write itself’!

Then, you pick and choose the pipeline steps, and the corpora on which they act.</p><p id="ede6" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">With that, I started a writing-tech consulting company, <a class="af pa" href="https://www.fintext.io/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">FinText</a>.

Market research and polling are big business. It’s now the height of the pandemic, everyone’s at home. I figured that processing active chatter on dedicated online communities could be a new way to access client thinking.</p><p id="5e5d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">Any first software client would have felt special, but <a class="af pa" href="https://www.fintext.io/case-studies/benchmarking/help-them-buy-your-esg-funds/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">this one</a> was thrilling, because my concoction actually helped real people get out of a tight spot:</p><p id="2682" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">Working towards a big event, they had planned to launch a flagship report, with data from a paid YouGov survey. But its results were tepid. So, with their remaining budget, they bought a FinText study. It was our findings that they put front and centre in their <a class="af pa" href="https://uksif.org/public-and-investor-attitudes-to-good-money-2020/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">final report</a>.</p><figure class="nj nk nl nm nn no ng nh paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="np nq ed nr bh ns"><div class="ng nh pg"><img src="../Images/4bbe75cbc97b44173678fc15b0fb1a65.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*W_q__FqPYGsMQYcd7VuiDg.png"/></div></div><figcaption class="nu nv nw ng nh nx ny bf b bg z dx">Social listening on Reddit ‘Investing’, 2020.

Investment land is quirky because pools of money will always need a home; the only question is who’s the landlord. Industry people I talked to mostly wanted to know what their competitors were up to.</p><p id="e412" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">So the second use case — competitive content analytics — was met with warmer response. I sold about half a dozen companies on this solution (including, for example, <a class="af pa" href="https://www.fintext.io/case-studies/benchmarking/competitive-content-analytics-for-aviva-investors/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Aviva Investors</a>).</p><p id="efce" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">All along, our engine was collecting data no one else had. Such was my savvy, it wasn’t even my idea to run training sessions, a client first asked for one. That’s how I learned companies like buying training.</p><p id="9d3a" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">Otherwise, my steampunk take on writing was proving tricky to sell. It was all too abstract. What I needed was a dashboard: pretty charts, with real numbers, crunched from live data. A pipeline did the crunching, and I hired a small team to do the pretty charts.</p><figure class="nj nk nl nm nn no"><div class="ph io l ed"><div class="pi pj l"/></div><figcaption class="nu nv nw ng nh nx ny bf b bg z dx">Text analytics dashboard demo.

I’ll say a few words about this choice.</p><p id="440e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">Everyone believes what they say matters. If others don’t care, really it’s a <em class="nf">moral</em> failure, of weighing style over substance. A bit like how bad taste is something only other people have.</p><p id="d75e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">Scientists have counted clicks, tracked eyes, monitored scrolls, timed attention. We know it takes a split second for readers to decide whether something is “for them”, and they decide by vaguely comparing new information to what they already like. Style is an entry pass.</p><h2 id="1a8a" class="nz oa fq bf ob oc od oe of og oh oi oj ms ok ol om mw on oo op na oq or os ot bk"><strong class="al">What The Dashboard Showed</strong></h2><p id="013f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go ou mn mo gr ov mq mr ms ow mu mv mw ox my mz na oy nc nd ne fj bk">Before, I hadn’t been tracking the data being collected, but now I had all those pretty charts. And they were showing I had been both right, and very, very wrong.</p><p id="c460" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">Initially, I only had direct knowledge of a few large investment firms, and had suspected their competitors’ flows look much the same. This proved correct.</p><p id="3cc2" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">But I had also assumed that slightly smaller companies would have only slightly fewer outputs. This just isn’t true.</p><p id="0b0b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">Text analytics proved helpful if a company already had writing production capacity. Otherwise, what they needed was a working factory. There were too few companies in the first bucket, because everyone else was crowding the second.</p><h2 id="eb14" class="nz oa fq bf ob oc od oe of og oh oi oj ms ok ol om mw on oo op na oq or os ot bk"><strong class="al">Epilogue</strong></h2><p id="7a7f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go ou mn mo gr ov mq mr ms ow mu mv mw ox my mz na oy nc nd ne fj bk">As a product, text analytics has been a mixed bag.

It’s an altogether different adventure, still in its infancy.</p><p id="3939" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mj mk fq ml b go mm mn mo gr mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne fj bk">In the end, I came to think of text analytics as an extra pair of glasses. On occasion, it turns fuzziness sharp. I keep it in my pocket, just in case.</p></div></div></div></div>
