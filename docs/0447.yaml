    in a couple of its provisions. Some of them regulating emotion recognition technologies,
    which got me admittedly more tangled up than I originally anticipated. Maybe I
    was just looking for an excuse for getting back into researching some of my personally
    favourite topics: human psyche, motivation and manipulation. In any event, I discovered
    many new and interesting technologies, but was disappointed to find much less
    exciting legal analyses of the questions they raise. As the hamster wheel in my
    head continued spinning, I couldn’t help myself but writing some of the things
    down.'

    set up the scene imagining a hypothetical (although to a greater degree already
    possible) scenario of a morning in the life of (scanned) Jane. Then, I will describe
    the technologies that could be used to make this hypothetical scenario a reality,
    together with referencing patents and papers justifying my claim that we are already
    at the point where Scanned Jane could exist somewhere out there. The point of
    this first part will be to demonstrate just how far the technologies can go and
    to hopefully make the readers wonder at which point the scenario goes from a utopia
    to a dystopia. At least for them personally.'

    persist in our legal frameworks. I will do that by focusing on the protection
    provided (or lack thereof) by the GDPR, the recently adopted Data Act, and the
    upcoming AI Act. The point being: these regulations fail miserably at protecting
    individuals from some of the (potentially) most useful and at the same time most
    easily misused technologies available nowadays. Especially when these are combined

    all-knowing AI *Lucy* (association with the [movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2872732/)
    is made very intentionally), it’s not at all so unimaginable that the described
    scenario might soon become reality. Smartwatches [measuring all types of activities
    and processing a whole stream of bodily data](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9712629B2/en?q=%28health+tracking+watch%29&oq=health+tracking+watch)
    (including even [blood sampling](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10194862B2/en?q=%28health+tracking+watch%29&oq=health+tracking+watch))
    are nothing new. Nor is the [possibility of connecting the collected data streams
    across multiple devices](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9712629B2/en?q=%28health+tracking+watch%29&oq=health+tracking+watch).
    (Just think about the fact that the [Internet of Things (IoT)](https://www.dataversity.net/brief-history-internet-things/)
    can be traced at least back to 1999.) The science behind “high-quality sleep”
    is also getting increasingly more predictable and therefore also adjustable. So
    much so that you can even connect your sensors to allow free data flows to your
    ‘[smart mattress](https://patents.google.com/patent/US11812859B2/en?q=%28sleep+analyitics%29&oq=sleep+analyitics)’
    that will then adjust the temperature, firmness, and other features. Finally,
    all the collected data can also already [help your device predict your mental
    and cognitive state](https://patents.google.com/patent/US11872041B1/en?q=%28smart+watch+health+analytics%29&oq=smart+watch+health+analytics)
    (even more so with [special smart glasses tracking your eye movements and brain
    waves](https://patents.google.com/patent/CN112034977B/en?q=%28samrt+interactive+glasses%29&oq=samrt+interactive+glasses)).
    This then in turn makes it possible to provide recommendations as to the actions
    you might want to take to improve your condition, but also to [help medical workers
    provide better treatments](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.05989.pdf). From there it
    is basically a baby step to also connect all that useful data, combine it with
    the data collected by your [smart glasses](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10176783B2/en?q=%28samrt+interactive+glasses%29&oq=samrt+interactive+glasses)
    and have super personalized predictions and recommendations. The glasses then
    also allowing for a seamless user experience. Of course, all the [newest smart
    glasses](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/09/new-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses/) also
    have full internet access and their own AI-powered smart voice assistants to basically
    act as your consciousness. (Or maybe in place of it?) Finally, the voice assistants
    are then more than capable of both [making decisions for you as well as executing
    those decisions](https://medium.com/@cognidownunder/the-rise-of-large-action-models-beyond-predictions-towards-actionable-ai-0510112e3500)
    if you give them the necessary permissions of course. And have enough confidence
    in their decisions. Not to mention [smart fridges](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20210383457A1/en?q=%28connected+refrigerator+automated+grocery+shopping%29&oq=connected+refrigerator+automated+grocery+shopping)

    affinity towards technology and the amount of control we are willing to give over.

    go through with our decisions ourselves.) I for one, am sure I’m not going to
    resolve to these technologies any time soon, but I’m certain some people will.
    And it is also my opinion that there should be something resembling a line of
