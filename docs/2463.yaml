- en: As someone who has been involved in hiring data scientists and applied scientists
    in Amazon for the past few years, either as the hiring manager, interviewer or
    interviewee, I have come to realize that while most candidates are familiar with
    the latest machine learning models, they often lack a solid understanding of the
    fundamentals of mathematics, statistics, and probability. This gap in foundational
    breadth of science knowledge can limit their ability to effectively define the
    right hypothesis to solve problems, collect the right type of sample or interpret
    the results of their scientific work. That is why I decided to create this post
    to explain the most common foundational topics for data scientists. The good news
    is that even an overall familiarity with these topics can set us apart from other
    candidates. These mathematical skills are powerful tools for better understanding
    the problems that we encounter daily as data scientists. By building these muscles
    and exercising them over time, we will reap the benefits throughout our careers.
