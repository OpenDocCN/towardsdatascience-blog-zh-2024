- en: In this article, I want to tackle some of the biggest challenges data engineers
    face when working with pipelines throughout the data lifecycle. Understanding
    how to manage the data lifecycle is key in our constantly changing field. As a
    data engineer, I often deal with huge volumes of different types of data, including
    unstructured data, coming from various sources like databases, data lakes, and
    third-party APIs. These factors can make managing critical data really tough.
    Weâ€™ll cover all the important stages of data processing, from collection and analysis
    to storage and destruction, and Iâ€™ll share the best practices I use every day.

    its useful life, from data creation to destruction where it becomes obsolete or
    needs to be destroyed due to compliance regulations.
