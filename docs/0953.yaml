    has been successfully productionized as Outsideâ€™s first LLM-powered chatbot, Scout.
    If you are an Outside+ member, you can check it out over at [https://scout.outsideonline.com/](https://scout.outsideonline.com/).

- en: This journey began as my weekend curiosity project back in March 2023\. I had
    the idea to build a Q&A chatbot using OpenAIâ€™s LLMs and Outsideâ€™s content as a
    knowledge base. Later I shared my prototype at our internal product demo day and
    I was thrilled by the interest it managed to spark. Scout quickly became an official
    project. On November 28th 2023, we launched Scout to limited Outside+ members.
    Fast forward to today, April 12th, 2024, over 28.3k unique users have already
    utilized this Outdoor Companion AI tool.
