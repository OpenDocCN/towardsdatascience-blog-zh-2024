- en: We used to focus on performance when we were writing code. It won’t be difficult
    for us to get thousands of articles if we search “python performance”. However,
    I rarely see articles that tell us to optimise the memory consumption of our code.

- en: Of course, performance is critical in programming, but memory consumption will
    decide how much money we need to spend on hardware. Consider that we are going
    to train a model on a big dataset. We may need a large VM with 64GB RAM to do
    the job. However, if we can optimise our code, 32GB RAM may be able to achieve
    a similar elapsed time. In that case, we may save lots of cost for the hardware
    resource.

    ways to measure it. Also, by knowing the approaches to measuring memory consumption,
    we will be able to quantify and benchmark it. So, in this article, the common
    memory-measuring approaches that I use to leverage will be introduced.
