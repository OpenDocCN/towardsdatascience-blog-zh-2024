If AI is better than labour, labour is automated, but if labour is better than AI, AI augments labour. <strong class="oc fr">These information is readily available</strong> — AI models are benchmarked against human performance in various tasks, providing timely insights into their relative capabilities.

This can happen when: i) new markets are unlocked by cost decreases, ii) there are network effects, iii) the products enable innovation. On the other hand, products with price-inelastic demand (e.g., tax software, fast food), due to i) market saturation and ii) low potential for new applications, lead to job displacement as demand does not increase due to cost decreases.</p><p id="0510" class="pw-post-body-paragraph oa ob fq oc b go ou oe of gr ov oh oi nn ow ok ol nr ox on oo nv oy oq or os fj bk">AI is a <strong class="oc fr">General Purpose Technology</strong> with the potential to reshape economic structures, similar to electricity and the steam engine.

Hence, the share of labour in the production of Task A declines, and the share of AI increases. In general, this means that more tasks become completely automated (i.e., wholly using AI as input). Holding the production structure (i.e., share of each task in the final output) constant, the quantity of labour demanded decreases (e.g., cashiers being replaced by self-checkout counters in supermarkets).</p><p id="2fa3" class="pw-post-body-paragraph oa ob fq oc b go ou oe of gr ov oh oi nn ow ok ol nr ox on oo nv oy oq or os fj bk">So, is this all doom and gloom for workers?

Even though Task A has been automated, Task B is non-automatable, as it requires human negotiation and discussion with clients. If Task B takes up the bulk of the time, a worker’s overall productivity will be constrained by the inefficiencies in Task B. For example:</p><p id="11c4" class="pw-post-body-paragraph oa ob fq oc b go ou oe of gr ov oh oi nn ow ok ol nr ox on oo nv oy oq or os fj bk">· A worker at the 5th percentile in Task A can use AI to achieve the productivity level of the 75th percentile, significantly boosting their overall output.</p><p id="4dbe" class="pw-post-body-paragraph oa ob fq oc b go ou oe of gr ov oh oi nn ow ok ol nr ox on oo nv oy oq or os fj bk">· Conversely, a 75th-percentile worker may see little improvement from AI, as their bottleneck lies in Task B, where no gains are made.</p><p id="c175" class="pw-post-body-paragraph oa ob fq oc b go ou oe of gr ov oh oi nn ow ok ol nr ox on oo nv oy oq or os fj bk">In economics terminology, there are <strong class="oc fr">strong complementarities</strong> between the automated Task A and inefficient Task B. The inefficiency of Task B effectively caps overall productivity gains, creating what <a class="af ot" href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3J3AzCbrjZ484moQUhOsZ1?si=4074a8cc39ca4167" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Michael Webb describes</a> ²³ as a <strong class="oc fr">performance ceiling: </strong>a limit beyond which further improvements in Task A lead to diminishing returns.

Perhaps the firm will engage in <strong class="oc fr">task specialisation</strong>, decoupling Task A and Task B and hiring separate workers for each. Hence, workers poor in Task A would be displaced, as they are no longer needed for Task B. Alternatively, further <strong class="oc fr">AI advancements</strong> can automate Task B as well (e.g., OpenAI Realtime improves to automate all simple customer service calls). Perhaps then you would see the top-quality customer assistants (e.g. those offering personalised counselling/coaching or emotional guidance) being augmented, while all the lower-quality ones will be automated.</p><p id="18cd" class="pw-post-body-paragraph oa ob fq oc b go ou oe of gr ov oh oi nn ow ok ol nr ox on oo nv oy oq or os fj bk">On the other hand, some argue that <strong class="oc fr">higher-skilled individuals will benefit more</strong> from AI augmentation.</p><p id="9338" class="pw-post-body-paragraph oa ob fq oc b go ou oe of gr ov oh oi nn ow ok ol nr ox on oo nv oy oq or os fj bk">Firstly, my framework leads to the obvious implication that higher-skilled workers are more likely to be <strong class="oc fr">augmented rather than automated</strong> in a given task.

Even if AI enables a productivity increase for lower-skilled workers in a certain task (let me bring back Task A of video-editing again), higher-skilled workers could be reallocated to other tasks, and the <strong class="oc fr">commoditisation of Task A</strong> (more abundant supply of Task A due to AI advancement) could lead to the <strong class="oc fr">price of task A declining</strong> (i.e., fall in <em class="qc">a</em>), leading to wages of workers specialising in Task A (the lower-skilled workers) stagnating.</p><p id="69ad" class="pw-post-body-paragraph oa ob fq oc b go ou oe of gr ov oh oi nn ow ok ol nr ox on oo nv oy oq or os fj bk">The dynamic effects are even more concerning for lower-skilled workers.

We were discussing the Hollywood actors’ strike in 2023 in opposition to film studios using AI voiceovers to replace minor roles, among other grievances.

Christopher Nolan, for instance, worked as a script reader and camera operator in his early years<a class="af ot" href="#_ftn26" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">[26]</a>. He might never have become who he is today if studios had replaced these opportunities in favour of AI. AI is like a tsunami — those who fail to make it to “higher ground” during the short window of opportunity pre-automation may be irreversibly devastated when the wave of automation hits.

In the post-WW2 era, demand for banking services surged, and human tellers were critical for routine tasks like cashing checks and depositing money. When ATMs became ubiquitous in the 1990s, they automated many of these routine tasks, significantly reducing the cost of operating bank branches. As a result, banks could <strong class="oc fr">open many more branches nationwide</strong>, serving a much wider population. Consequently, <strong class="oc fr">teller employment increased</strong>, with their roles evolving from manual tasks to a focus on customer service, sales and specialised client requests.</p><p id="5307" class="pw-post-body-paragraph oa ob fq oc b go ou oe of gr ov oh oi nn ow ok ol nr ox on oo nv oy oq or os fj bk">Other examples of increasing affordability making products much more accessible were cars and televisions in the 20th century, and now, perhaps new tech products such as drones, augmented reality home cinemas, which are becoming more accessible to average consumers due to continuous improvements in quality and reductions in cost.</p><p id="5e32" class="pw-post-body-paragraph oa ob fq oc b go ou oe of gr ov oh oi nn ow ok ol nr ox on oo nv oy oq or os fj bk">Additionally, <strong class="oc fr">network effects </strong>can amplify the effect of cost reductions, as the value of the product increases as more people use it. For example, platforms like Slack, Google Docs and Zoom, which have reduced the complexity and hence cost of remote collaboration, driving adoption. As more users gain, the utility of these platforms only increases, creating a virtuous cycle of increased adoption and value.</p><p id="ebca" class="pw-post-body-paragraph oa ob fq oc b go ou oe of gr ov oh oi nn ow ok ol nr ox on oo nv oy oq or os fj bk">Perhaps this is also why TikTok is very interested in developing AI tools to simplify video-making.

The best example is semiconductors. Initially used only in military applications due to high costs, semiconductors became exponentially cheaper and more powerful, enabling a cascade of innovations — from personal computers to smart devices (such as fridges and TVs). Today, this fact is true more than ever, (as we will cover more in the next article), as semiconductors are in insatiable demand by Big Tech companies, powering the development and deployment of advanced AI models. Despite the performance of semiconductors doubling every 2 years (Moore’s law), demand for semiconductors is still skyrocketing, with GPU production <a class="af ot" href="https://epoch.ai/blog/can-ai-scaling-continue-through-2030" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">projected to double annually through 2030</a> ³⁰.</p><p id="8878" class="pw-post-body-paragraph oa ob fq oc b go ou oe of gr ov oh oi nn ow ok ol nr ox on oo nv oy oq or os fj bk">On the flip side, some products exhibit <strong class="oc fr">price-inelastic demand</strong>, meaning that demand will not increase even if costs dramatically decrease.

However, these jobs are poorly paid and are unlikely to see much improvements in productivity or demand in the future, hence there are few opportunities for economic advancement.</p><p id="bdab" class="pw-post-body-paragraph oa ob fq oc b go ou oe of gr ov oh oi nn ow ok ol nr ox on oo nv oy oq or os fj bk">More than the <strong class="oc fr">level of AI exposure,</strong> we should also look at the <strong class="oc fr">rate of change</strong>. Once again, charts showing the rate of progress of AI models on different tasks are very informative.</p><p id="1596" class="pw-post-body-paragraph oa ob fq oc b go ou oe of gr ov oh oi nn ow ok ol nr ox on oo nv oy oq or os fj bk">My criteria for a desirable job: the job contains mostly <strong class="oc fr">non-automatable tasks</strong>, but also a <strong class="oc fr">non-trivial amount of automatable tasks where AI is improving rapidly in. </strong>This will support productivity growth of that job. Furthermore, the job must be in an <strong class="oc fr">innovative field </strong>where productivity improvements will likely lead to <strong class="oc fr">significant demand increases.</strong></p><p id="101c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph oa ob fq oc b go ou oe of gr ov oh oi nn ow ok ol nr ox on oo nv oy oq or os fj bk">One example I have in mind is a <strong class="oc fr">tech product manager (PM)</strong>. A PM’s core responsibilities — understanding of the product, industry and users, as well as facilitating communication and collaboration between engineers and business teams — are fundamentally non-automatable. However, a PM’s role also includes automatable tasks (e.g. meeting scheduling, making mock-ups on Figma, prototyping, producing pitch decks, monitoring user activity and developers’ progress), which AI is making rapid progress in (AI agents to schedule meetings, Figma’s text-to-design, text-to-PPT, and more AI-powered monitoring dashboards). This enables a PM’s productivity to increase significantly, allowing him to focus more time on his core skillsets, manage larger teams and/or design and rollout new features and products more effectively. Moreover, there is literally no end of problems that good software products can solve — the demand for software is virtually unlimited. Hence, productivity improvements will lead PMs to be able to do more, rather than have fewer PMs do the same work. These arguments also apply to tech entrepreneurs.</p><p id="dabe" class="pw-post-body-paragraph oa ob fq oc b go ou oe of gr ov oh oi nn ow ok ol nr ox on oo nv oy oq or os fj bk">Ideally, you should also look at jobs allowing you to gain ownership of capital which is driving automation. Gaining equity (common in tech companies) or rising to executive positions in firms increasing using AI will enable you to reap a portion of the gains from automation in capital income, instead of relying on your wages which could be a shrinking pie.</p><p id="85a5" class="pw-post-body-paragraph oa ob fq oc b go ou oe of gr ov oh oi nn ow ok ol nr ox on oo nv oy oq or os fj bk">By focusing on roles that balance human ingenuity with AI-driven productivity gains, and by seeking ownership in automation capital, we can navigate this era of transformation not just with resilience but with the potential for growth and impact.</p><h2 id="e982" class="nc nd fq bf ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz bk">Is AI automation all that bad?</h2><p id="1269" class="pw-post-body-paragraph oa ob fq oc b go od oe of gr og oh oi nn oj ok ol nr om on oo nv op oq or os fj bk">Lastly, I also wanted to challenge the notion that AI automating jobs is purely doom and gloom. Just because machines can perform certain tasks better than humans does not eliminate all value from such activities or the skills associated with them.</p><p id="9f42" class="pw-post-body-paragraph oa ob fq oc b go ou oe of gr ov oh oi nn ow ok ol nr ox on oo nv oy oq or os fj bk">For instance, the invention of cars, cameras, and speakers did not diminish the value of running, painting, or playing music. Sure, it means that the people who specialised in running, painting and making music as their primary means of income needed to adapt, but many humans still enjoy these activities as <strong class="oc fr">leisure activities and hobbies.</strong> In fact, being able to engage in such pursuits <strong class="oc fr">for their own sake</strong>, untainted by the pressures of commercialisation, is far more enjoyable.</p><p id="f984" class="pw-post-body-paragraph oa ob fq oc b go ou oe of gr ov oh oi nn ow ok ol nr ox on oo nv oy oq or os fj bk">This vision aligns with the utopian ideal depicted in popular culture, such as Isaac Asimov’s <em class="qc">I, Robot</em>, where AI automates all economic work, freeing humans to focus on intellectual and leisure pursuits unburdened by the need to make a living. In such a world, if you are skilled in an automated task, you could in fact still finding purpose and income by teaching other people these skills for leisure (e.g. running coaches, art instructors and music teachers). Ultimately, humans would gravitate toward the one truly non-automatable product by definition: activities deriving their value from human connection, such as personalised coaching, fostering human relationships, and emotional engagement.</p><p id="00c7" class="pw-post-body-paragraph oa ob fq oc b go ou oe of gr ov oh oi nn ow ok ol nr ox on oo nv oy oq or os fj bk">However, I am not naïve to think that such a world is the likely outcome. Realising this vision hinges on whether humanity can redistribute the gains from AI equitably, so that those whose economic value has been automated away can still be given their fair share of resources to live a meaningful life. This is obviously a huge challenge, given the unequal and commercialised world of today. While exploring this is beyond the scope of this article, I hope to address how AI might reshape the broader economic system in future pieces.</p><h2 id="2da1" class="nc nd fq bf ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz bk">Conclusion</h2><p id="1f7c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph oa ob fq oc b go od oe of gr og oh oi nn oj ok ol nr om on oo nv op oq or os fj bk">In conclusion, AI will undoubtedly have profound impacts on the economy, with performance improving and costs diminishing rapidly. Using an economically grounded framework, I explain why some workers will be displaced while some will be augmented by AI, with AI’s impact on workers hinging on a critical metric: whether AI performs better than the worker in tasks relevant to his occupation. Whether high-skilled or low-skilled workers benefit more depends on the nature of firm’s production. However, the way AI is currently used is not a good indicator for its economic promise, as it is a General Purpose Technology and will create new systems, products and drive significant productivity gains in the long-term.</p><p id="7b1f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph oa ob fq oc b go ou oe of gr ov oh oi nn ow ok ol nr ox on oo nv oy oq or os fj bk">I close the discussion by stating certain characteristics of occupations that are desirable to be in. I encourage more economists to leverage AI model benchmarks to create timely and granular assessments of the automation potential of workers in different occupations, to determine quantitatively what the desirable occupations are.</p><p id="d963" class="pw-post-body-paragraph oa ob fq oc b go ou oe of gr ov oh oi nn ow ok ol nr ox on oo nv oy oq or os fj bk">Ultimately, AI, just like any technology, is inherently neutral, and its societal impact will be determined by the choices we make. It is imperative for AI practitioners, economists, and policymakers to work together to ensure that AI will positively impact the economy and society, through redistribution mechanisms and thoughtful regulation that strike a balance between fostering innovation and ensuring equity.
