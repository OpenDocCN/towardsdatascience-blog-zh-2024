- en: '**The name “Monte Carlo” for the Monte Carlo methods has an origin that ties
    back to the famous Monte Carlo Casino located in Monaco. This name was not chosen
    because of any direct association with the mathematical principles behind these
    methods, but rather for its metaphorical connection to randomness and chance,
    which are central elements in both gambling and Monte Carlo simulations. In this
    post, we will discuss this technique and show code examples related to project
    management, approximating irregular areas, and gaming.**'

- en: Real-world systems and processes often involve uncertain parameters and variables.
    With Monte Carlo methods you can explicitly model these uncertainties. Businesses
    can make better informed decisions by understanding the probability and impact
    of different risks. Besides decision support, you can use it for enhancing predictive
    models and/or communication.

    is one problem: you can’t see inside it to count how many of each color there
    are. You want to know which color you’re most likely to pick if you reach in the
    jar without looking.'
