- en: Those who have worked in the past with the NER (named entity recognition) paradigm
    know well the value of having a performing model for the task on which it has
    been trained.

    tasks** — they are the foundation of every digital intelligence task and in myriad
    tasks linked to larger and more complex data science pipelines.

- en: Those who do NER also know how complex it is to train such a model due to the
    enormous amount of labels to be specified during the training phase. Libraries
    like SpaCy and transformer-based Hugging Face models have greatly helped data
    scientists develop NER models in an increasingly efficient manner, which still
    improves the process up to a certain point.

    for entity extraction that combines the classic NER paradigm with the power of
    LLMs.**
