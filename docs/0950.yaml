    hackathon that was organized by xfb Analytics[1], Transfermarkt[2], and Football
    Forum Hungary[3].

    blog post about the approach I used.

- en: The goal was to pick a Premier League team, analyze their playing style, highlight
    two flaws, and prepare two lists of 5 players each that could help the team improve.
    The premise was that we had to look to fill two different positions (hence the
    “two lists of 5 players each”).

    explain why they were the best fit for their respective positions.

    to be below 60M (we were given their Transfermarkt valuations).

    data science guy who loves football so I had to perform some sort of technical
    analysis or modeling with Python.
