    who ask it and those who answer: “How do you partition a dataset into training
    and test sets?”'

- en: 'When approaching a supervised problem, it is common practice to split the dataset
    into (at least) two parts: the training set and the test set. The training set
    is used for studying the phenomenon, while the test set is used to verify whether
    the learned information can be replicated on “unknown” data, i.e., data not present
    in the previous phase.'

    The common, unexciting answer is: “I randomly partition the available data, reserving
    20% to 30% for the test set.”'

    sampling randomly while maintaining fixed proportions with one or more variables.
    Imagine we are in a binary classification context and have a target variable with
    a prior probability of 5%. Random sampling stratified on the target variable means
    obtaining a training set and a test set that maintain the 5% proportion on the
    target variable’s prior.'
