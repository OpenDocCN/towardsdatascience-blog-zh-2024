    aims to show you how to set up an AWS Lambda function and also to show you my
    problem-solving approach, figuring out how to set up a Lambda function for the
    first time. Hopefully, this will show you how to approach new problems within
    computer science and figure out a way to solve them. Being able to figure out
    problems yourself is a crucial skill within programming, and developing this skill
    is one of the main motivations of this article.

    new concepts that are important for me as a data scientist. One of the most important
    parts of being a data scientist is continuously updating your knowledge. I realized
    I had a limited understanding of deploying functions to the cloud, which is important
    if you, for example, want to host your machine learning model. I, therefore, set
    out to learn how I can deploy functions using AWS Lamba functions. Another important
    motivation for this tutorial is to show you my approach to problem-solving, as
    I will be working on a task I have little prior knowledge of. This article should…
