    thanks to the release of the publicly available AI models, like ChatGPT, Gemini,
    Claude, etc. As we all know, their capabilities were initially limited to understanding
    and generating texts, but soon after, they got their ability to perform the same
    thing on images as well. Talking more specifically about generative models for
    image data, there are actually plenty number of model variations we can use, in
    which every single of those has their own purpose. So far, I already got some
    of my articles about generative AI for image data published in Medium, such as
    Autoencoder and Variational Autoencoder (VAE), which I’ve linked at the end of
    this article. In today’s article, I am going to talk about another fascinating
    generative algorithm: The Neural Style Transfer.'

    Style*” written by Gatys et al. back in 2015 [1]. It is explained in the paper
    that their main objective is to transfer the artistic style of an image (typically
    a painting) onto a different image, hence the name “Style Transfer.” Look at…
