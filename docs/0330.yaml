    this question. It brings me down to earth and makes me consider whether I’ve made
    the best use of my time in the past week or if I’m just “busy”.

    like something of a status symbol in our deranged work-obsessed society. If you’re
    not busy, you’re not working hard enough to make it as a data scientist — there
    will always be someone who will work harder and take your place in a heartbeat.
    But as [John Spencer so succinctly puts it:](https://medium.com/@spencerideas/the-difference-between-busy-and-productive-bdb08cb5986a)
    “You don’t get a trophy for packing your schedule with more projects and more
    accomplishments and more meetings”. Of course, we subconsciously know this, but
    somehow we keep working like we will get some award or some bonus or some raise
    — even though we all know that our hard work will go unnoticed 9 times out of
    10 because we’re just in the data department.

- en: An example of a task matrix to help you prioritize your tasks. I couldn’t improve
    on this example by [Asana](https://asana.com/resources/eisenhower-matrix). While
    we may not all be in a position where we can delegate tasks (I jokingly delegate
    my urgent but not important tasks to my dog), it’s still a relevant category in
    which you can place your tasks (perhaps just change the headlines depending on
    your needs).

    matrix will increase your productivity as a data scientist.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whenever I’m feeling overwhelmed with the number of tasks piling up, I write
    them all out on pieces of paper and then begin to categorize them by their urgency
    and importance, using the same formula as the Eisenhower Matrix you see above.
    This immediately provides a clear picture of what needs to be done, what can wait,
    and what is irrelevant. These tasks might be unique to a specific data analysis
    you’re conducting for a client (so you would build a matrix on a project-by-project
    basis), or they might just be the tasks you have for an entire workweek.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Productivity stems from focusing on what is immediately urgent and getting rid
    of all the distractions and unnecessary tasks that crowd our desks. In data science
    where most of your work is wrapped up in producing deliverables for deadlines,
    this can be a handy way of ensuring that you’re prioritizing the right stuff.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, it’s also important to not get too wrapped up in ensuring that everything
    falls into these categories as we *think* it should. Your boss will inevitably
    give you a task that you think is neither urgent nor important (like changing
    the chart bars from red to orange), but to them, it will be. This is not a war
    to fight. However, for the rest of your standard tasks, you can generally get
    away with organizing them this way with very effective results.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Productivity stems from having a clear roadmap of what we want to accomplish
    and how we plan on getting there. Yearly resolutions are not going to get you
    through the days, weeks, months, and multitude of projects therein, which is why
    you need to set these types of goals accordingly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’ll rarely see someone accomplish their big yearly goal if they don’t have
    a framework of goals for each day, week, month, and project leading up to the
    end of the year. Similar to the phenomenon of [people losing motivation to complete
    their New Year’s Resolutions by February](https://abcnews.go.com/US/struggling-new-years-resolutions-track/story?id=96173041#:~:text=The%20failure%20rate%20for%20New,U.S%20News%20and%20World%20Report.),
    you won’t have a very productive year as a data scientist if you don’t have some
    daily, weekly, monthly, and project-oriented goals to push you forward.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the data science work environment, most of these goals will be set for you
    by your project team, all of which will revolve around project deadlines. However,
    there will be some leeway in how you go about achieving the goals unique to your
    part of the project. To ensure you’re productive in achieving these over-arching
    goals, you’ll need to weave in your own set of goals to ensure that each day,
    week, and month leading up to a project deadline is full of productive work. These
    could be small, such as, “On Friday, I will have read the client-provided documentation
    and will have my notes and questions ready for the meeting next Monday”, or large,
    such as, “By the end of the month, I will have refined my model to give statistically
    significant results to p<0.05”.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whatever your goals, you should have a monthly calendar filled with goals color-coded
    by whether they’re goals for the day, week, month, or are affiliated with a specific
    project deadline. This gives you a clear roadmap of what you need to be accomplishing
    each day to remain productive.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One last thing to note is that you should only pick 2–3 goals for each day.
    Be realistic with yourself about how long it will reasonably take to complete
    these goals. By keeping the number of daily goals achievable, you’re ensured to
    have achieved some level of success at the end of each day — and who doesn’t need
    that?

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The “screen time” feature implemented on many popular devices has been revolutionary
    for me in thinking differently about how much time I’m *actually* spending on
    work. You may think you’re busy at work, but the amount of time your phone says
    you’ve been on Instagram today begs to differ.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tracking your time can be a game-changing tactic to help you determine how much
    time you’re spending on work each day, how much time you’re spending on each type
    of task, and whether or not that time is truly productive work. It can also give
    you a good idea to see if certain tasks are taking you longer than they should.
    For example, perhaps you’re spending too much time on making data visualizations.
    This could be fixed by creating a stylesheet and sticking to it to ensure that
    you’re not wasting time looking at fonts or making sure your colors are accessible
    to all viewers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are time-tracking apps available (one of my favorites being [Forest](https://www.forestapp.cc/))
    but I find that using the timer on your phone and the Notes app is the simplest
    way. But heck, you’re a data scientist, why don’t you just write the code to automate
    this task? All you need to do to get started is to start the clock when you begin
    working, stop the clock when you’re finished, and then make a note on your phone
    of how long you worked and what task you were working on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s truly eye-opening to have your working hours right in front of your eyes.
    You may be contracted to work 9–5, but how many hours are you truly working? Further,
    how many of those hours would you deem to have been productive? The jury is still
    out on the golden number of hours we’re productive in a work day, with it currently
    residing somewhere between [2–6](https://irisreading.com/how-many-hours-a-day-can-a-human-actually-work-what-science-recommends/#:~:text=For%20most%20people%2C%20the%20actual,a%20human%20to%20be%20productive.).
    From personal experience conducting data analyses and computer modeling, my limit
    on productive work seems to hinge somewhere between 5 and 6 hours — anywhere beyond
    that and my brain feels like it’s fried. However, it’s important to note that
    this varies depending on the work I’m doing. Technical work with deep dives into
    code or data (especially when it’s not cooperating as it should) drains me much
    quicker than if I’m writing a report or creating pretty visualizations. This will
    be unique for everyone, so it’s not a bad idea to also log how you feel at the
    end of each workday to see if you can begin to sense some patterns in the tasks
    you work on, your productivity, and your energy levels.

  prefs:

    a meeting, answering emails, and petting my dog while I’m trying to write them.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While everyone has a different working style that works for them, I think we
    can all agree in 2024 that multi-tasking is probably the most ineffective productivity
    hack ever known. Instead, time blocking has begun to take its place as a true
    method for increasing productivity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Time blocking](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/time-blocking) is
    when you allocate certain chunks of time within your day to a specific task. For
    example, the first two hours of your workday could be allocated to administrative
    tasks, such as answering emails and attending your daily standup meeting. The
    next hour of your workday could be focused on dealing with your bug backlog. After
    lunch, you dedicate three hours to cleaning, preparing, and analyzing data. The
    last hour of your day is spent in a couple of meetings.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why does time blocking make you more productive? It allows you to settle into
    a task or specific type of work by not allowing for distractions that might break
    your stream of focus. For example, you’re not going to get anywhere in debugging
    your code if you’re constantly having team members poke their heads into your
    office to ask you questions. Our best work gets completed when we can singularly
    focus on what is required, and our “busy” work happens when we have six different
    distractions demanding our attention away from what needs to be done.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Time blocking can be challenging to do in an office environment due to your
    accessibility to those around you. However, blocking off sections of time within
    your day in a shared calendar space and ensuring your office door stays closed
    during those deep work periods can be a great way to start this productivity habit.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I found time blocking around the time when I began working with data and code
    again and found it to be the best tool in my productivity toolbox. Giving yourself
    three uninterrupted hours to work with code or data allows you to live within
    it, get a deeper understanding of how the data fits together, and get a clearer
    picture of how the code is supposed to work. In other words, working for three
    uninterrupted hours will produce better, more efficient results than working for
    six interrupted hours.

- en: Your potential for productivity as a data scientist is only as strong as the
    tools you surround yourself with.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To start, pick three areas of your work that need some organizing and streamlining.
    For example, this could be your code version control, your daily schedule and
    project planning, and your tendency to get distracted and start doomscrolling
    when your code stops working. From there, decide whether you want to handle these
    areas in a digital or analog manner — in other words, do you need a tool on your
    computer or do you need a physical solution? For code version control, you’ll
    need a digital version control repository, such as that available through GitHub.
    To handle your daily schedule and project planning, you could go analog or digital.
    Going analog could mean buying yourself a daily planner for your scheduling and
    a wall calendar for your project management. Digitally, some of the go-to tools
    include Notion, which could be used for both daily schedules and project planning,
    and Trello, a handy little tool for project planning. Finally, dealing with your
    doomscrolling can be as easy as installing website blockers on your work devices
    and setting your phone to “Do Not Disturb”. There, you just set up a productivity
    workflow!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Productivity workflows are unique systems, which means that trial and error
    will be involved. For example, I found that I loved using GitHub Desktop to make
    my code commits, but couldn’t be bothered to use Git from the command line. In
    the same way, I use Notion to plan my projects but just use the calendar on my
    phone to schedule my day. Further, I need my phone to be in a completely different
    room if I need to get some deep work done. It’s a great idea to look up other
    people’s productivity workflows on sites like Medium and YouTube to get some inspiration
    and ideas for which tools might work best for you, but it’s never a good idea
    to base your workflow on someone else’s. It may take a few months to perfect your
    system, but you’ll know that it’s the right one for you when you don’t even have
    to think about it.

    a meeting

    importance of communication skills for data scientists, many of us are admittedly
    less accomplished at these skills than we like to admit. We may be masters at
    communicating data stories to a client, but we may fall short at communicating
    where it can really make a difference: with our teams.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nothing stalls productivity more for a data scientist than team members poking
    their heads in or sending Teams messages asking them to re-explain a task that
    needs to be done. Even worse, is working within a team who doesn’t have a good
    concept of what topics or crises require a meeting. While there are exceptions
    to both of these scenarios, such as working with interns or actually having something
    blow up, more often than not, these small productivity inconveniences can be eliminated.
    It all starts with strong, clear communication.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At a personal level, begin practicing your communication skills when it comes
    to explaining tasks, concepts, and results. This can be as easy as talking to
    your [desk duck](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/rubber-duck-debugging/) or
    your mom, writing blog posts and articles online, or creating YouTube tutorials.
    Whatever your method, practice communicating until you can get your point across
    once without follow-up questions. If you do get a follow-up question, see if you
    can answer it without getting a second. Clear, concise communication only once
    per question = more flow state productivity for you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At a team level, set some team standards (and more importantly, enforce and
    stick to them) for what constitutes the need for a meeting. Virtual or in-person,
    meetings are more often than not a drain on productivity and energy when they’re
    not spent tackling an honest problem. This simple task is a quick way to produce
    constructive teamwork and communication that can easily be modified to fit the
    workflows and projects that may come up.

    to fix your computer model because, more often than not, you’ll probably make
    things worse, or more likely yet, won’t get anything moving in the remote direction
    of “fixed”.

    your day off by making a master to-do list of everything you need to get done
    that day. Referencing your task-prioritization matrix (see tip #1 above) comes
    in handy here. Pick 1–2 tasks that you know would just drain the life force out
    of you and work on those first thing — the rest of your tasks can be worked on
    later. Save mindless tasks or tasks you find easy, for the mid-to-late point in
    your workday where you begin feeling more sluggish and uninspired. You’ll find
    after a couple of days of doing this that your days start more productive and
    remain more productive until the time when you log off.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I once worked on a team where one of the members was new to team leadership
    on this scale and had a lot at stake regarding how well the team performed. This
    resulted in this team leader not trusting their team members to do their work,
    so while task delegation occurred, it always resulted in the team leader being
    deeply involved, often right up until the time the tasks were due. Naturally,
    this devolved into everything being completed only at the last minute, with the
    team leader always asking for last-minute changes to be made down to the last
    second before task submission. This often looked like a lot of “busy” work followed
    by one or two 12-hour days trying to make changes before the submission deadline.
    Not a very healthy work environment where every single project comes down to the
    last second, right?
  prefs: []

    ways to ensure your productivity as a data scientist. Whether you’re a single
    data scientist at a small startup or part of a team of data professionals at a
    large corporation, setting up effective inter- and intra-team systems is paramount
    to your productivity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of which require that each party trust that the other can complete their work
    to a set standard by a set deadline. While many of us can feel as though we’re
    on an island while working, it’s important to remember that our results and deliverables
    are often depended upon by other members of an organization to complete their
    tasks. As such, teams should get together early on to establish standards for
    deciding who needs to be working together, which tasks need to be delegated where,
    and how long before project deadlines these tasks need to be completed to ensure
    sufficient time for edits.

    world — if we’re not constantly moving towards a state of disorder, then we’re
    disobeying the laws of physics in a concerning way. Data can be harder to wrangle
    than expected, your teammate may get egregiously ill while they’re supposed to
    be visualizing data only they understand, your predictive model may be returning
    results that are suspect at best, and your supervisor may give you last-minute
    corrections seconds before the deliverable is supposed to be sent out. However,
    even just having the above-suggested standards in the back of each team member’s
    mind can be enough to make everyone a little more cognisant of how to work together
    more productively. The way to make this stick a little better every time is to

    of your productivity strategies.

    what worked, what didn’t, and how you could be more productive next month. Maybe
    this means you need to develop a better folder system for your data storage, or
    maybe you need to delegate more explanatory tasks to your analysts to allow the
    scientists to focus on more predictive tasks. Maybe you just need to put your
    foot down and put your phone in a time-locked security box to keep from “doomscrolling”
