    pretending to be humans. That distinction between “human-made” and “machine-made”
    looks more relevant each day, isn’t it?

- en: In this post, I’ll explain briefly how the Turing Test got the status of the
    ultimate proof of human-level intelligence and then how this status was lost.
    Then, I mention some good alternatives to use instead for testing human –and even
    super-human– level cognition.

    professionals as we are flooded by “intelligence” or even “consciousness” claims
    that are mostly noise and hype.

    murky because that’s the name of a movie about Turing’s personal life and struggles
    — which were big.

    as well as how Benedict Cumberbatch delivered the lead role, the “imitation game”
    is not the same as the “Turing machine,” which is not the same as the “Enigma
    machine.” The film confused them all.
