- en: Within the geosciences, Python is becoming increasingly popular and is often
    recommended as a starting point for anyone interested in learning a programming
    language. It can be used for research and development, creating custom applications
    to automate workflows, and it can also be used as an aid when learning geoscience
    topics.

    how the parameters of the Archie equation can impact the final result. Especially
    if you are just starting out.

- en: Learning programming is not a new phenomenon within geoscience. It has been
    common within the oil and gas industry for many geoscience professionals to write
    their own code or algorithms. Often this would be in earlier languages such as
    FORTRAN and C. Some of the older professionals still prefer to create their own
    apps today using these languages. However, they can often be difficult to work
    with and not very easy to understand for the new programmer.

    nature, and has access to a large amount of open-source libraries. Even ones for
