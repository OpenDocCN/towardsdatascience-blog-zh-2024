- en: Neural networks have become a powerful method in machine learning models in
    recent years. The activation function is a central component in every neural network,
    which significantly influences the model’s functionality. It determines how strongly
    a neuron in the network is activated and thus decides which structures are learned
    from the data. Without the activation functions, the neural networks could only
    recognize linear relationships and would not be able to produce the impressive
    results that have kept us in suspense in recent years.

    and compare the different functions that are commonly used. We also provide tips
    on how to find the right activation function for the network architecture and
    the specific use case to train an optimal model. However, before we can dive into
    the topic, we should understand how neural networks and more specifically the
    neurons in them work to see in which system the activation function is embedded.
