    PDF report consisting of text and tables. A colleague has already extracted the
    information using Optical Character Recognition (see [last week’s post](/python-might-be-your-best-pdf-data-extractor-f5d42e2634b7)).'

- en: Unfortunately, rather than a structured dataset, this file is rather messy —
    you find redundant headers, extraneous footnotes, and irregular line breaks. Numbers
    are inconsistently formatted, and data descriptors are scattered throughout, rendering
    any meaningful analysis nearly impossible without significant preprocessing. It
    looks like you will be facing hours of tedious data cleaning today.

    it is a powerful tool for pattern matching in text. It sounds simple, but allowing
    users to define, search, and manipulate specific patterns within text makes it
    an excellent tool for cutting through messy data.

- en: This piece shall provide a bit more background on Regex, and how it is implemented
    in Python. We then dig deeper into the essential Regex features for data cleaning,
    and provide a hands-on example (that we very recently faced at Wangari) to illustrate
    how this works in practice. If you…
