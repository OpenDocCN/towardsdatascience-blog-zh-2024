    remember your transition coming from an individual contributor role? As of the
    time of writing, I have been leading data science teams for the past 4 to 5 years,
    but I still remember one the my main struggles at the beginning of my journey
    as a manager: **time management**.'

- en: Data Scientists or Sr Data Scientists individual contributors tend to focus
    on 1 or 2 problem spaces. The IC role is supposed to provide you the space to
    deliver on a deep problem, removing noise from other projects and admin work.
    You will probably have *some* ad-hoc chats with engineering colleagues or other
    data science peers, but these are the necessary because technical designs and
    system dependencies are important for delivery. Of course, one must attend weekly
    meetings with stakeholders, but probably you get 1 of these per week. Therefore,
    let’s say that as an IC, your week is around 20% meetings with 80% technical work.
