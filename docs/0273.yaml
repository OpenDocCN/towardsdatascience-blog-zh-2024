    which have limited language capabilities, by enabling them to support multiple
    languages. However, there is one major drawback of MT — often, it fails at translating
    named entities that are not translatable word-by-word. For example, the German
    title of the movie “The Pope Must Die” is “Ein Papst zum Küssen”, which has the
    literal translation: “A Pope to Kiss”. As the correctness of the named entities
    is crucial for QA systems, such a challenge has to be handled properly. In this
    article, we present our entity-aware MT approach called “Lingua Franca”. It takes
    advantage of knowledge graphs in order to use information stored there to ensure
    the correctness of named entities’ translations. And yes, it works!'

- en: Achieving high-quality translations depends significantly on accurately translating
    named entities (NEs) within sentences. Various methods have been proposed to enhance
    the translation of NEs, including approaches that integrate knowledge graphs (KGs)
    to improve entity translation, recognizing the pivotal role of entities in overall
    translation quality within the context of QA. It is important to note that the
    quality of NE translation is not an isolated objective; it has broader implications
    for systems involved in tasks such as information retrieval (IR) or knowledge
    graph-based question answering (KGQA). In this article, we will delve into a detailed
    discussion of machine translation (MT) and KGQA.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, multilingual KGQA systems play a crucial role in addressing the
    “digital language divide” on the Web. For instance, Germany-related Wikipedia
    articles, especially those dedicated to cities or people, contain more information
    in the German language than in other languages — this information imbalance can
    be handled by the multilingual KGQA system that is, by the way, the core of all
    modern search engines.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the options for enabling the KGQA system to answer questions in different
    languages is to use MT. However, an off-the-shelf MT faces notable challenges
    when it comes to translating NEs, as numerous entities are not readily translatable
    and demand background knowledge for accurate interpretation. For instance, consider
    the German title of the movie “The Pope Must Die,” which is “Ein Papst zum Küssen.”
    The literal translation, “A Pope to Kiss,” underscores the need for contextual
    understanding beyond a straightforward translation approach.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Given the limitations of conventional MT methods in translating entities, the
    combination of KGQA systems with MT often results in distorted NEs, significantly
    reducing the likelihood of accurate question answering. Therefore, there is a
    need for an enhanced approach to incorporate background knowledge about NEs in
    multiple languages.

    Machine Translation (NEAMT)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3587259.3627567)
    aimed at enhancing the multilingual capabilities of KGQA systems. The central
    concept of NEAMT involves augmenting the quality of MT by incorporating information
    from a knowledge graph (e.g. [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) and [DBpedia](https://www.dbpedia.org/)).
    This is achieved through the utilization of the “entity-replacement” technique.

    components within our NEAMT framework, which are available in our [repository](https://github.com/dice-group/LFQA).
    Finally, the approach is evaluated on two KGQA systems: [QAnswer](https://qanswer.ai/)
    and [Qanary](https://github.com/WDAqua/Qanary). The detailed description of the
    approach is available at the figure below.'

    using the entity-replacement technique. Subsequently, these entities are substituted
    with their corresponding labels from a knowledge graph in the target translation
    language. This meticulous process ensures the precise translation of questions
    before they are addressed by a KGQA system.

    we designate English as the common target translation language, leading to the
    nomenclature of our approach as “Lingua Franca” (inspired by the meaning of [“bridge”
    or “link” language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_franca)). It is essential
    to note that our framework is versatile and can seamlessly adapt to any other
    language as the target language. Importantly, Lingua Franca extends beyond the
    scope of KGQA and finds applicability in various entity-oriented search applications.

    (NER) and Named Entity Linking (NEL), (2) the application of the entity-replacement
    technique based on identified named entities, and (3) utilizing a machine translation
    tool to generate text in a target language while considering information from
    the preceding steps. Here, English is consistently used as the target language,
    aligning with related research that deems it the most optimal strategy for Question
    Answering (QA) quality. However, the approach is not limited to English, and other
    languages can be employed if necessary.'

    KGQA systems that were using our approach outperformed the ones that used standard
    MT tools. To verify the statement above, we conducted the Wilcoxon signed-rank
    test on the same data. Based on the test results (p-value = 0.0008, with α = 0.01),
    we rejected the null hypothesis which denotes that the QA quality results have
    no difference, i.e., while combining KGQA with standard MT and while combining
    KGQA with the approach. Therefore, we conclude that the approach, which relies
    on our NEAMT framework, significantly improves the QA quality while answering
    multilingual questions in comparison to standard MT tools.
