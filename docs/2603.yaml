- en: One was about a new 3.5 Haiku model that promises to emulate the abilities of
    the current 3.0 Opus model but should be much quicker and cheaper to use. This
    was a “coming soon” announcement, as the new model won’t actually be released

    kind of ability ***could*** be slightly concerning. Claude has kicked that particular
