    the best performer, and tweaking some settings, deep learning doesn’t play by
    the same rules. If you’ve ever experimented with Neural Networks, you might’ve
    noticed their performance can be pretty hit or miss. You might even have seen
    something as straightforward as Logistic Regression beat your fancy 200-layer
    Deep Neural Network.

- en: Why does this happen? Deep learning is among the most advanced AI techniques
    we have, but it demands a solid understanding and careful handling. Knowing how
    to fine-tune a Neural Network, getting what’s going on inside it, and mastering
    its use are crucial. That’s what we’re diving into today!
