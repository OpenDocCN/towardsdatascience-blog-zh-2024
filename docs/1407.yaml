    are all that a successful ad campaign needs. It suggests that brands should focus

    it is unwise for Ecommerce businesses to blindly trust ad platforms for several

- en: Ad platforms rely on advanced machine learning models to deliver ads to the
    right audience. When a new ad is introduced, algorithms enter a learning phase
    where they collect data on user interactions with the new ad. Interactions like
    clicks and conversions signal positive engagement, increasing the ad’s relevance
    score, and leading to a positive feedback loop. After the initial learning period,
    algorithms continue to learn from user interactions and dynamically adjust ad
    placements based on the latest data.

    If the brand runs an ad for its professional gear without specific targeting,
    the algorithms will show the ad to a broad audience. Since ad platforms don’t
    segment shoppers exactly like the brand does, the ad might end up being shown
    to casual players, who aren’t as likely to engage with it. This lack of engagement
    sends negative signals to the algorithms, lowering the ad’s relevance score and
    making it harder to secure prime ad placements.

    Given that each ad gets a limited budget and only runs for a short period, the
    algorithms struggle to gather enough performance data. This makes it tough to
    pinpoint the best audience for each ad. Consequently, the algorithms end up showing
    these ads to a lot of unsuitable shoppers, which decreases the ad’s relevance
    score and drives up ad costs.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When brands run large promotions for special events or product launches, their
    ads temporarily become more appealing. Heavy discounts can attract customers who
    wouldn’t normally buy their products. These temporary spikes in user interaction
    can confuse the algorithms, leading them to misinterpret typical user behaviors.
    As a result, the cost per acquisition often goes up after these big promotions,
    forcing brands to spend significantly on ads to correct this disruption.

    on factors including age, income, and level of competitiveness. One cohort was
    middle age adults who lived in upscale suburban neighborhoods and preferred to
    purchase the brand’s professional equipment. Another was young urban professionals
    who preferred entry-level equipment and played the sport casually. With these
    insights, the brand was able to precisely target different cohorts using age and
    location, and feature different products and sports settings in their ad campaigns
    for each cohort.

    have a lot of alternatives to structure their product offerings. Many brands have
    told us that they know some customers don’t need discounts to make a purchase,
    but they’re unsure how to provide different promotions to different segments.
    The good news is customer segmentation and precise ad targeting provide new opportunities.

    strategy is to offer unique promotions for each type of product. For example,
    an apparel brand can promote limited-edition accessories for affluent customers.

    among young adults.
