    have shown incredible capabilities, and these capabilities have recently been
    extended beyond the text. On the one hand, we have witnessed multimodal models
    (e.g., [vision-language models](https://huggingface.co/blog/vlms)); on the other
    hand, we have witnessed an extension of model capabilities to skills that require
    [reasoning](https://github.com/atfortes/Awesome-LLM-Reasoning). For example, we
    now have models dedicated to solving math problems or writing code.'

    In fact, a great deal of data in the real world can be represented in the form
    of graphs. For example, social networks are data that are structured as graphs
    precisely because it is important to represent the relationship between various
    entities. This is not the only example: in biomedical sciences it is common to
    represent [molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_graph#:~:text=the%20following%20classical%20definition%20is,graph%20correspond%20to%20chemical%20bonds),
    and [interactions between proteins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10450), as graphs.
    However, the interaction between LLMs and graphs is recent…'
