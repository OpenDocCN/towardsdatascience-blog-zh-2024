- en: It was a typical Friday afternoon right at the end of a long week of work on
    our project developing a radically new concept and app for molecular graphics
    in augmented and virtual reality, when I found myself in a heated discussion with
    my friend and colleague. He is a “hardcore” engineer, web programmer, and designer
    who has been in the trenches of web development for over a decade. As someone
    who prides himself on efficiency and control over every line of code and especially
    who always has the user and user experience in mind, my friend scoffed at my idea
    of voice interfaces becoming soon the norm…

    he said not with these exact words but certainly meaning them, and voicing a sentiment
    that many in the tech community share. And this was already after having kind
    of convinced him, maybe by 30–50%, that our augmented / virtual reality tool for
    molecular graphics and modeling absolutely needs such kind of human-computer interaction
    because since the users’ hands are busy…
