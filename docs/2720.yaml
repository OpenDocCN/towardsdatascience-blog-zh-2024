- en: Markov Decision Problems (MDP) are a central topic in robotics and AI as they
    are the gateway to more complex topics such as Reinforcement Learning and Partially
    Observable MDPs. In the large majority of online materials, MDP are explained
    using a “grid world” example. If you find it difficult to see the real world applications
    of this example and looking for a more classical MDP representation, this article
    is for you! After motivating MDPs using a robotic decision making problem, we
    will formally model the MDP, introduce the Bellman equation and value iteration,
    and provide a simple Python implementation.

- en: The robot first drives to a fridge to look for a sandwich there, and as this
    turns out to be unsuccessful, takes the elevator to get one at Subway. While this
    sounds like a logical sequence of actions, you might ask why does it actually
    go to the fridge first? Here it makes sense to briefly think about what the pros
    and cons of each…
