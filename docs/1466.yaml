    and ML engineers are often the primary roles highlighted. However, in reality,
    it takes a village to deliver the product. In a [previous article](https://medium.com/@ebrahimian.mahsaa/fraud-prediction-with-machine-learning-in-financial-industry-a-data-scientists-experience-b3ffc32d27cc),
    we discussed the steps involved in developing a fraud prediction product using
    machine learning. In this article, we will explore the various roles in such a
    project and how each contributes to its success. Disclaimer: Not all projects
    will necessarily have teams or individuals with the exact titles listed below;
    depending on the company structure, one person may wear multiple hats and fulfill
    several roles. Here, I outline the structure based on my experience of working
    on different fraud prediction projects with ML/AI.'

    for the project’s plan and its execution. At the beginning of the project, they
    help define the plan and set deadlines based on stakeholders’ requests and the
    technical team’s capacities. Throughout the project, they constantly monitor progress.
    If the actual state of tasks or deliveries deviates from the plan, they need to
    raise a flag and coordinate with the teams. As a result, they spend most of their
    time communicating with different teams, higher-level managers, and business stakeholders.
    Two major challenges in their job are:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Interdependency between Technical Teams**: This makes the role challenging
    because the outputs from one team (e.g., data engineers ingesting the data) serve
    as inputs to another team (e.g., data scientists consuming the data). Any delay
    or change in the first step impacts the second step. Project managers, though
    not typically super technical, need to be aware of these changes and ensure proper
    communication between teams.'

    and evaluation of fraud prediction models. From the beginning of the project,
    they provide insights into active fraud trends, common fraudulent scenarios, and
    red flags, as well as exceptions or “green flags.” Data scientists incorporate
    this knowledge during the feature creation/engineering phase. Once the model is
    running in production, constant monitoring is required to maintain or improve
    performance. At this stage, fraud analysts are essential in identifying the model’s
    true or false positives. This identification can result from a thorough investigation
    of the customer’s history or by contacting the customer for confirmation. The
    feedback from fraud analysts is integral to the feedback loop process.

    of ML/AI fraud projects. Their support is essential for removing obstacles and
    building consensus on the project’s strategic direction. Therefore, they need
    to be regularly updated about the project’s progress. So that they can support
    championing investments in necessary teams, tools, and processes based on the
    project’s specific requirements and ensure appropriate resources are allocated.
    Additionally, they are responsible for holding internal and external parties accountable
    for data privacy and compliance with industry standards. By fostering a culture
    of accountability and providing clear leadership, they help ensure that the project
    meets its goals and integrates smoothly with the organization’s overall strategy.
    Their involvement is vital for addressing any regulatory concerns, managing risk,
    and driving the project toward successful implementation and long-term sustainability.

    which is an essential step in any ML project. They are responsible for designing
    and maintaining data pipelines, whether for real-time data streams or batch processes
    in data warehouses. Involved from the project’s inception, data engineers identify
    data requirements, sources, processing needs, and SLA requirements for data accessibility.

    essentially handling the ETL process. They also manage and maintain these pipelines,
    addressing scalability requirements, monitoring data quality, optimizing queries
    and processes to improve latency, and reducing costs.

    types of information for the business. In reality, we wear many different hats
    throughout the day. We start by identifying the business problem, understanding
    the data and available resources, and defining a solution, translating it into
    technical requirements.

    to implement solutions. We also work with business stakeholders to communicate
    results and receive feedback. Model evaluation is another critical responsibility,
    which involves selecting proper metrics to assess the model’s performance, continuously
    monitoring and reporting on it, and watching for any decay in performance.

- en: Once data engineers and data scientists build the data pipelines and model,
    it’s time to put the model into production. MLOps engineers play a crucial role
    in this phase by bridging the gap between development and operations. In the context
    of fraud prediction, timing is critical since the business needs to prevent fraud
    before it happens, necessitating a pipeline process that runs in less than a second.
    Therefore, Mlops engineers ensure that models are seamlessly integrated into production
    environments, maintaining reliability and scalability. MLOps engineers design
    and manage the infrastructure needed for model deployment, implement continuous
    integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, and monitor model performance
    in real-time. They also handle version control, automate testing, and manage model
    retraining processes to keep models up-to-date. By addressing these operational
    challenges, MLOps engineers enable the smooth and efficient deployment of machine
    learning models, ensuring they deliver consistent and valuable outcomes for the
    business.

    roles interact differently depending on the stage of the project and each specific
    company. In my experience, in the begining of the project, fraud analysts, high
    level managers and data scientists work together to define the strategy and requirements.
    Data scientist’s play a significant role in identifying the business problem.
    They collaborate with Mlops and Engineering to translate it into a technical solution.
    Data engineers need to come along to discuss required pipeline developments. One
    common challenge is when there is a disconnect between these teams and it just
    emerges at the time of execution. This can impact timelines and the quality of
    the deliverable. Therefore the more integrity between these teams, the smoother
    will be the implementation and delivery.
