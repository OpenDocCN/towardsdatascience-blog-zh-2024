    a key characteristic for Data Scientists (and numerous other professions).

  prefs:

    learning and adaptation in the rapidly evolving field of data science.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a curious mindset encourages Data Scientists to stay abreast of emerging trends,
    embrace new tools, and refine their skills.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’ve experienced moments in my career where I would focus on a topic for months,
    lowering my head and forgetting about everything else. At some point, my curiosity
    brings me back to earth and urges me to open my eyes and look for what happened
    in the field during that span. Without it, I would get stuck and become outdated.

    and is also often about finding new ways to apply old and proven approaches to
    new domains in ways that have not been tried before.

    a team composed of people with diverse backgrounds has more chance to foster creativity.

    your colleagues, be curious about unorthodox career paths, and you might find
    gems.

    name, but it is very important to remember that a Data Scientist must apply a
    scientific approach to solving problems using data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    robust, reliable, and reproducible. Applying scientific rigor mainly refers to
    adhering to a rigorous methodology, and critically evaluating findings.

    But you won’t be a good Data Scientist without it.

    exercising scientific rigor is vital to mitigate the risk of erroneous conclusions.
    That’s why, whenever I discuss experiments and results with a colleague, I tend
    to value the scientific approach over the results in the first phase.

    go anywhere and lose your time. Unfortunately, most people jump on the first available
    version of a problem because they prefer writing code. So, the solution is simple,
    invest more time in defining the problem, discussing desired outcomes with stakeholders,
    and setting proper starting hypotheses/constraints.

    scientific approach needs a fair use of statistical tools. For example, statistical
    tests will help you check for feature correlation or data distribution. So, if
    you’re not comfortable with it, think about leveling up your statistical arsenal.
