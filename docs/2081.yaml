- en: The Artificial Intelligence hype has tangible benefits for those interested
    in the underlying principles. The field advances at a rapid pace, and reading
    preliminary studies is surprisingly enjoyable. However, the downside of this tempo
    is the vast array of (sometimes) chaotic and incoherent terminology that accompanies
    it. As a result, I often revisit my decade old-lecture notes or books to refresh
    my knowledge gaps. This, combined with my desire to experiment with newer findings,
    has led to my renewed interest in the intersection of human-machine learning.

    from the human brain’s architecture. Revisiting this fact led me to a seemingly
    basic question: Can machines learn from each other in ways analogous to human
    learning?'

- en: While this topic isn’t novel — indeed, it’s the very basis of neural networks
    — the broader implications, from dystopian scenarios to the excitement fueled
    by cutting-edge AI demonstrations, are mesmerizing. Beyond this latent feeling
    of AI autocatalysis, my question carries some immediate relevance. Two intertwined
    issues emerge. First, many data scientists acknowledge the growing challenge of
    data…
