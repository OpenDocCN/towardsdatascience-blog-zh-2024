- en: Let me introduce you to Sarah, a talented and passionate data scientist, who
    just landed her dream job at GreenEnv, a large company that makes eco-friendly
    cleaning products. GreenEnv has tons of data on customers, products, and other
    areas of the business. They hired Sarah to unlock the hidden potential within
    this data, uncovering market trends, competitive advantages, and more.

    marketing campaigns. Confident in her abilities and excited to apply data science
    methods, Sarah dived into the customer database. But her initial excitement quickly
    faded. The data was a mess — inconsistent formatting, misspelled names, and duplicate
    entries everywhere. **Data quality** was terrible. There were variations of names
    like “Jhon Smith” and “Micheal Brown” alongside entries like “Jhonn Smtih” and
    “Michealw Brown.” Emails had extra spaces and even typos like “gnail.com” instead
    of “gmail.com.” along with many other inaccuracies. Sarah realized the hard job
    ahead of her — data cleaning.'

- en: Inconsistent formatting, missing values, and duplicates would lead to skewed
    results, giving an inaccurate picture of GreenEnv’s customer base. Days turned
    into weeks as Sarah tirelessly cleaned the data, fixing inconsistencies, filling
    in gaps, and eliminating duplicates. It was a tedious process, but essential to
    ensure her analysis was built on a solid foundation.

    top-selling items and recommend future opportunities. However, she encountered
    a different problem — a complete lack of **metadata**. Product descriptions were
    absent, and categories were ambiguous. Basically, there wasn’t enough data to
    help Sarah to understand the product’s data. Sarah realized the importance of
    **metadata management** — structured information about the data itself. Without
    it, understanding and analyzing the data was almost impossible.

    its own internal jargon and classification systems. Marketing and sales refer

    by different departments, outdated storage systems struggling to handle the growing
    volume of data, and Sarah had to wait for a long time for her queries to be executed.
    Sarah noticed also there are no clear rules on who can access what data and under
    what terms, without centralized control and proper access controls, the risk of
    unauthorized access to sensitive information increases, potentially leading to
    data breaches and compliance violations. The lack of **data governance**, a set
    of rules and procedures for managing data, was evident.

    a data management expert XD), I’ve come to appreciate and favor the following
    points regarding data management and its best practices, especially if we are
    focusing on data quality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There’s no one-size-fits-all solution to data management. While frameworks exist
    to guide organizations towards data management maturity, the full process remains
    unique for each entity. Each organization prioritizes different aspects of data
    management and faces distinct challenges.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My approach would be to start simple. Apply data management best practices or
    enhancements to a targeted portion of the organization’s data, focusing on what
    matters most. This allows for gradual growth in maturity, eventually encompassing
    all data. This phased approach can be very beneficial for dimensions like data
    quality and metadata management.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If a process consistently generates bad data, even the best efforts in other
    areas of data management won’t prevent it. These processes can be technical or
    non-technical. A proactive approach is crucial here.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '- For example, a non-technical process that generates bad data might involve
    database creation by developers who solely focus on the technical aspects. There
    might be a lack of documentation or column descriptions for instance. A good practice
    in my opinion would be to engage data analysts and other relevant stakeholders
    in the design process to ensure adherence to data management best practices. The
    data management team can decide if we would go forward with a certain application
    design or not.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_IND
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '- An application’s design can also be a technical process for bad data generation.
    A well-designed application should enforce data quality proactively during data
    entry. For instance, instead of a text box for entering gender, a dropdown menu
    could be used. Another example might be predefining email types, where the user
    only needs to add their username before automatically receiving “@gmail.com” or
    another domain extension.'

- en: 'Standardization is key: Inconsistency in data can be a nightmare. Imagine customer
    names stored differently across departments, dates in conflicting formats, or
    teams using their own abbreviations. but more than that within a single organization
    or a company there might be different processes that generate the same type of
    data, and different data collection tools. Standardization combats this chaos
    by establishing common formats, definitions, and processes for data handling.
    This ensures data quality, simplifies integration across applications, fosters
    collaboration through a shared data language, and boosts efficiency by streamlining
    data workflows. This process is also iterative and agile, the organization can
    gradually achieve more levels of maturity in it. This one can also be part of
    the previous data management process of validation of applications that generate
    data: adherence to standards. i.e. any application to be approved should comply
    to the standards first.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, data management is a comprehensive process that requires collaboration
    across different teams within the organization, with the need to define the data
    management strategy and align it with the business or institute’s objectives and
    strategies. This would typically start with assessing the current and desired
    data management maturity levels, analyzing the gap, prioritizing data management
    tasks, and remaining agile. The process is iterative, and clear solutions rarely
    exist in advance.
