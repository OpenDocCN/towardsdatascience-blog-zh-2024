    analysis by The Information, based on previously undisclosed internal financial
    data and people involved in the business. If we’re right, OpenAl, most recently
    valued at $80 billion, will need to raise more cash in the next 12 months or so.

    becoming clearer and more urgent for the industry that has sprung up around this
    technology.

    really is for generative AI. What should we be expecting, and what’s just hype?
    What’s the difference between the promise of this technology and the practical
    reality?

- en: I’ve had this conversation with a few people, and heard it discussed quite a
    bit in media. The difference between a technology being a *feature* and a *product*
    is essentially whether it holds enough value in isolation that people would purchase
    access to it alone, or if it actually demonstrates most or all of its value when
    combined with other technologies. We’re seeing “AI” tacked on to lots of existing
    products right now, from text/code editors to search to browsers, and these applications
    are examples of “generative AI as a feature”. (I’m writing this very text in Notion
    and it’s continually trying to get me to do something with AI.) On the other hand,
    we have Anthropic, OpenAI, and assorted other businesses trying to sell products
    where generative AI is the central component, such as ChatGPT or Claude.
  prefs: []

- en: This can start to get a little blurry, but the key factor I think about is that
    for the “generative AI as product” crowd, if generative AI doesn’t live up to
    the expectations of the customer, whatever those might be, then they’re going
    to discontinue use of the product and stop paying the provider. On the other hand,
    if someone finds (understandably) that Google’s AI search summaries are junk,
    they can complain and turn them off, and continue using Google’s search as before.
    The core business value proposition is not built on the foundation of AI, it’s
    just an additional potential selling point. This results in much less risk for
    the overall business.

- en: The way that Apple has approached much of the generative AI space is a good
    example of conceptualizing generative AI as feature, not product, and to me their
    apparent strategy has more promise. At the last WWDC Apple revealed that they’re
    engaging with OpenAI to let Apple users access ChatGPT through Siri. There are
    a few key components to this that are important. First, Apple is not paying anything
    to OpenAI to create this relationship — Apple is bringing access to its highly
    economically attractive users to the table, and OpenAI has the chance to turn
    these users into paying subscribers to ChatGPT, if they can. Apple takes on no
    risk in the relationship. Second, this doesn’t preclude Apple from making other
    generative AI offerings such as Anthropic’s or Google’s available to their user
    base in the same way. They aren’t explicitly betting on a particular horse in
    the larger generative AI arms race, even though OpenAI happens to be the first
    partnership to be announced. Apple is of course working on [Apple AI, their own
    generative AI solution](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/29/apple-releases-apple-intelligence-its-long-awaited-ai-features.html),
    but they’re clearly targeting these offerings to augment their existing and future
    product lines — making your iPhone more useful — rather than selling a model as
    a standalone product.

    AI can and should be worked in to a business strategy, and building the technology
    itself is not guaranteed to be the most successful. When we look back in a decade,
    I doubt that the companies we’ll think of as the “big winners” in the generative
    AI business space will be the ones that actually developed the underlying tech.

    enough to be worth having, right? If the money isn’t in the actual creation of
    generative AI capability, are we going to have this capability? Is it going to
    reach its full potential?

- en: I should acknowledge that lots of investors in the tech space do believe that
    there is plenty of money to be made in generative AI, which is why they’ve sunk
    many billions of dollars into OpenAI and its peers already. However, I’ve also
    written in several previous pieces about how even with these billions at hand,
    I suspect pretty strongly that we are going to see only mild, incremental improvements
    to the performance of generative AI in the future, instead of continuing the seemingly
    exponential technological advancement we saw in 2022–2023\. (In particular, the
    limitations on the amount of human generated data available for training to achieve
    promised progress can’t just be solved by throwing money at the problem.) This
    means that I’m not convinced that generative AI is going to get a whole lot more
    useful or “smart” than it is right now.

    that having a highly advanced technology is very different from being able to
    create a product from that technology that people will purchase and making a sustainable,
    renewable business model out of it. You can invent a cool new thing, but as any
    product team at any startup or tech company will tell you, that is not the end
    of the process. Figuring out how real people can and will use your cool new thing,
    and communicating that, and making people believe that your cool new thing is
    worth a sustainable price, is extremely difficult.

    channels, but some of these ideas are falling pretty flat. [OpenAI’s new beta
    of a search engine, announced last week, already had major errors in its outputs](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/07/searchgpt-openai-error/679248/).
    Anyone who’s read [my prior](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/what-does-it-mean-when-machine-learning-makes-a-mistake-37b213200697)
    [pieces](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/is-generative-ai-taking-over-the-world-a970a5ccdad5)
    about how LLMs work will not be surprised. (I was personally just surprised that
    they didn’t think about this obvious problem when developing this product in the
    first place.) Even those ideas that are somehow appealing can’t just be “nice
    to have”, or luxuries, they need to be essential, because the price that’s required
    to make this business sustainable has to be very high. When your burn rate is
    $5 billion a year, in order to become profitable and self-sustaining, your paying
    user base must be astronomical, and/or the price those users pay must be eye-watering.

    in a difficult spot. Research for research’s sake has always existed in some form,
    even when the results aren’t immediately practically useful. But capitalism doesn’t
    really have a good channel for this kind of work to be sustained, especially not
    when this research costs mind-bogglingly high amounts to participate in. The United
    States has been draining academic institutions dry of resources for decades, so
    scholars and [researchers in academia have little or no chance to even participate
    in this kind of research without private investment](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/03/10/big-tech-companies-ai-research/).
  prefs: []

- en: I think this is a real shame, because academia is the place where this kind
    of research could be done with appropriate oversight. Ethical, security, and safety
    concerns can be taken seriously and explored in an academic setting in ways that
    simply aren’t prioritized in the private sector. The culture and norms around
    research for academics are able to value money below knowledge, but when private
    sector businesses are running all the research, those choices change. The people
    who our society trusts to do “purer” research don’t have access to the resources
    required to significantly participate in the generative AI boom.

    have the resources to sustain the mad dash to training more and bigger models,
    which brings us back around to the quote I started this article with. Because
    of the economic model that is governing our technological progress, we may miss
    out on potential opportunities. Applications of generative AI that make sense
    but don’t make the kind of billions necessary to sustain the GPU bills may never
    get deeply explored, while socially harmful, silly, or useless applications get
    investment because they pose greater opportunities for cash grabs.
