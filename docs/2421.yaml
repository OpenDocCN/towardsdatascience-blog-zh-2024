    It’s a really simple concept, allowing you to work out — theoretically — where
    something can be seen from. There are two main forms of visibility analysis —
    also know as viewshed analysis or ZTVs (Zones of Theoretical Visibility). These
    are:'

    on top of a mountain, what will my view be?'

    the line of sight between every part of that relief model and the observer points.
    Sounds like it would be a slow process, right? It can be. But the results are
    amazing, and indispensible for some applications.

    new development — such as a wind farm, solar panel site or highway — will be visible
    from. Analysts can then model different scenarios based on their findings, such
    as what happens to visibility if they plant a line of trees in this **exact**
    location? Visibility analysis can also be used to drive pricing strategies for
    billboards or help…
