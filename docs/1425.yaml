    from 3 years of developing machine learning models to predict fraud in the financial
    industry in a few articles. So If you play any roles of project manager, data
    scientist, ML engineer, data engineer, Mlops engineer, fraud analyst or product
    manager in a fraud detection project , you may find this article helpful.

    help us send money to loved ones and make purchases easier. But fraudsters use
    these systems to trick others into sending them money or taking over their accounts
    for fraud. This hurts both the victims and the companies involved, causing financial
    losses and damaging reputations. Moreover there are also the regulatory and compliance
    implications for the companies and liable parties in the system ([For instance
    western union was charged $586 million in 2017 for failing to maintain an efficient
    anti money laundering and consumer fraud system](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2017/01/western-union-admits-anti-money-laundering-violations-settles-consumer-fraud-charges-forfeits-586)
    ). Predicting the fraudulent transactions before the funds fall into the hands
    of fraudsters is vital for the companies. This is where AI/ML driven fraud management
    tools come into play.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is crucial to understand the different goals of stakeholders to align them
    and clarify expectations from the beginning. For example, from the compliance
    team’s perspective, a high detection rate of fraud is desirable, while the marketing
    team may be more concerned about the impact of false positives on customer experience.
    Meanwhile, the operations team may require a specific SLA for the timing of predictions
    to ensure smooth operations. It is inefficient to optimize all these potentially
    conflicting objectives in one phase of the project. Therefore, leadership support
    is essential for setting priorities and finding common ground.

    avoid feeding poor-quality data into the ML model, we need to analyze the data
    sources and their quality to ensure they meet both experimentation requirements
    and online streaming standards. Identify constraints in the existing data and
    articulate their impact on the quality of predictions. This step is crucial for
    maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the model’s outputs.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The building blocks of an ML model are features. In the context of fraud prediction,
    these features primarily represent fraudulent behaviors or red flags. At this
    stage, we extract the tacit knowledge of fraud experts and translate it into a
    list of red flags, which are then developed into features to feed into the model.

    high risk country, High number of distinct customers sending money to one person
    in a short time period, etc.'

- en: At this stage, the identified red flags are coded into features. Various feature
    groups can be defined, such as remittance features, transaction patterns, and
    user behavior metrics. Feature engineering is a crucial step in deriving the most
    informative features that distinguish fraud from non-fraud. This process involves
    selecting, modifying, and creating new features to improve the model’s accuracy
    and predictive power.

    fraud with reasonable accuracy. The desired accuracy level depends on business
    requirements and the extent of improvement needed over the baseline system (this
    is were the objectives defined in step two are referred to).

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All previous steps were conducted in an offline, batch environment. Once the
    model is ready, it must be deployed in production so that its predictions can
    serve downstream systems in real-time (less than one second in our projects).
    The MLOps team is responsible for this step, optimizing the runtime of the pipeline
    and ensuring seamless integration with other systems.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once the model’s predictions are integrated into real-time systems and utilized
    by the operations team, it is crucial to closely monitor performance. The goal
    is to ensure that the real-time performance aligns with the expected results tested
    in the batch environment. If discrepancies arise, it is essential to identify
    and address the underlying issues. For example, monitoring should include tracking
    the number of transactions processed by the model, the number of transactions
    predicted as fraud, and the subsequent journey of these transactions. Additionally,
    the performance of the pipeline itself must be monitored to ensure the service
    is up and running as expected.

- en: 9\. Setting Up the Feedback Loop Process
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Establishing a feedback loop process is essential to continuously evaluate the
    model’s performance and refine it accordingly. This process involves incorporating
    actual labels back into the system, along with any additional pertinent information.
    For example, if transactions were flagged as fraud by the model, it is important
    to track how many of these were investigated and the outcomes of those investigations.
    Similarly, insights from a quality assurance team, including potential reasons
    for false positives, should be incorporated back into the system to enhance the
    feedback loop process. This iterative approach ensures ongoing improvement and
    optimization of the fraud detection model.
