    logic that can be accurately modelled. However, most of the time we are dealing
    with a real world that consists of many rules that do not follow any patterns.
    One of the best examples is the public holidays. Holidays could be very different
    in various countries even their subdivisions. If our program needs to deal with
    dates, very unlikely we can bypass holidays.

    backend database and update it every year. However, sometimes our program needs
    to deal with a large number of different countries, or there is too much overhead
    to store all the holidays in the backend database if your application is small-scoped.
    Sometimes, our applications or data analytics environment may even don’t have
    a backend database.

    from 141 different countries. Also, many built-in useful tricks make it very easy
    to use. Let me introduce you to this amazing library in this article.
