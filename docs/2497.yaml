- en: The 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, awarded for groundbreaking advances in protein
    structure prediction and design using AI, reflects the transformative moment we
    (scientists at the interface between chemistry and biology) are going through.
    And it is even more notable after another Nobel Prize being awarded, just a day
    before, to those who developed the very basis of AI.

- en: At its core, the ability to reliably predict protein structures with AI is reshaping
    both basic and applied biological research. Besides, the work by DeepMind and
    by Prof. Baker’s Institute for Protein Design established pillars for many others,
    a huge community indeed, to build upon. You got a glimpse into it in my summary
    above, but let’s dive into this as I connect you to other blog posts where I develop
    the subtopics deeper.
