- en: Providing value and positive impact through machine learning product initiatives
    is not an easy job. One of the main reasons for this complexity is the fact that,
    in ML initiatives developed for digital products, two sources of uncertainty intersect.
    On one hand, there is the uncertainty related to the ML solution itself (*will
    we be able to predict what we need to predict with good enough quality?*). On
    the other hand, there is the uncertainty related to the impact the whole system
    will be able to provide (*will users like this new functionality? will it really
    help solve the problem we are trying to solve?*).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'All this uncertainty means failure in ML product initiatives is something relatively
    frequent. Still, there are strategies to manage and improve the probabilities
    of success (*or at least to survive through them with dignity!*). Starting ML
    initiatives on the right foot is key. I discussed my top learnings in that area
    in a previous post: start with the problem (and define how predictions will be
    used from the beginning), start small (and maintain small if you can), and prioritize
    the right data (quality, volume, history).'

    which splits the phases of an ML project into business understanding, data understanding,
    data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment. Although these phases
    are drawn as consecutive steps, in many representations of this lifecycle you’ll
    find arrows pointing backward: at any point in the project, you might learn something
    that forces you to go back to a previous phase.'

    finish. For example, during the evaluation step, you might realize thanks to model
    explainability techniques that a specific feature wasn’t well encoded, and this
    forces you to go back to the data preparation phase. It could also happen that
    the model isn’t able to predict with the quality you need, and might force you
    to go back to the beginning in the business understanding phase to redefine the
    project and business logic.

    **things won’t go according to plan**, to embrace all this uncertainty from the
    beginning, and to use it to your advantage. This is important both to managing
    stakeholders (expectations, trust) and for yourself and the rest of the team (motivation,
    frustration). How?

    laptop are over. Today, the true potential of ML is realised when models are deployed
    and integrated into the company’s processes. This means more people and skills
    need to collaborate to make that possible (Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers,
    Backend Developers, Data Engineers…).

    successfully build the end-to-end ML solution. However, more than a group of roles
    covering a list of skills is required. Having a **diverse team** that can bring
    different perspectives and empathize with different user segments has proven to
    help teams improve their ways of working and build better solutions (“[*why having
    a diverse team will make your products better*](https://open.nytimes.com/why-having-a-diverse-team-will-make-your-products-better-c73e7518f677)”).

    go beyond the team itself. I refer to these other people as “***the network***”.
    The network is people you know are really good at specific things, you trust to
    ask for help and advice when needed, and can unblock, accelerate, or empower you
    and the team. The network can be your business stakeholders, manager, staff engineers,
    user researchers, data scientists from other teams, customer support team… Ensure
    you build your own network and identify who is that ally who you can go to depending
    on each specific situation or need.
