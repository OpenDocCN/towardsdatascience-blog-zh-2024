- en: When I started in Data Science, my focus was primarily on improving technical
    skills like programming and model building. After a few years, my interest shifted
    towards model deployment and MLOps, leading to my transition into Machine Learning
    Engineering. Public speaking and presentations were always part of the job, especially
    when conveying results to a non-technical audience. However, things changed last
    year when I started working on more complex projects with potential reputational
    or financial risks for the hiring companies.

    non-technical reviewers before going live in production. This necessitated proper
    documentation, covering everything from architecture and training methodology
    to performance reports and experiment history. It meant that having good performance
    was not enough; I had to convince others, from data scientists to risk assessment
    specialists, that my models were not only effective but also safe.
