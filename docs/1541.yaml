    machine learning has been invaluable. As a fan of video games and gamification,
    I appreciate how Kaggle’s ranking and points system encourages participants to
    improve their models through healthy, constructive competition. Kaggle has become
    so popular, that many instructors have incorporated Kaggle as part of their preferred
    tools to teach machine learning.

- en: However, as a business school instructor who teaches some machine learning courses,
    I’ve found that using Kaggle as a tool to evaluate my students’ final machine
    learning projects a little bit cumbersome. For starters, tracking students submissions
    is tedious and manual, and my students (please note that most of them are beginners
    to data science and programming in general), often find it discouraging to see
    the result of their efforts ranked at the bottom of the Kaggle ranking. Having
    said this, I think that it is important to acknowledge that Kaggle wasn’t designed
    as a teaching tool, which explains its limitations in this context.
