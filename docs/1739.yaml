- en: I have heard many times data scientists frustrated due to the lack of cool projects
    to work on within their company. Convincing business stakeholders and management
    to start AI projects can be challenging. While it is not usually the data scientist’s
    responsibility to think and propose the projects that need to be prioritized,
    I’ve seen how data scientists together with data managers and product managers
    can influence the roadmaps and help introduce more innovative and impactful projects.

    I’ve seen successfully influence the team or company culture towards introducing
    more innovative ML or AI based projects. Be aware this is not something that happens
    from one day to another, but a journey in which your knowledge and motivation
    can help others in your company to think outside of the box and see the potential
    of ML and AI.

    are: raising awareness, inspiring through use cases, finding sponsors & ideas,
    and prioritization.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first step is to raise awareness on your organization about what AI can
    and cannot do. Many people have limited understanding of AI, which can lead both
    to skepticism and unrealistic expectations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The end goal at this first step would be to help people around you to gain
    sensibility about AI. This sensibility can include: what is the difference between
    ML and AI, what type of problems can I solve with traditional ML (classification,
    regression, time series…), what new opportunities appear now with GenAI (text
    generation, image generation, few shot classification…). Some strategies to reach
    this awareness are:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Workshops and trainings**: these can be organized in-house, or you can also
    recommend online courses. The second option is usually faster and less expensive;
    courses like “[*AI For Everyone*](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/ai-for-everyone/)”
    and “[*Generative AI For Everyone*](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/generative-ai-for-everyone/)”
    from *deeplearning.a*i are always a good start.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Empower & encourage everyone to use GenAI**: this can be done by casually
    explaining how you leverage GenAI yourself, by sharing images and poems obtained
    through it, or by challenging why they haven’t used it yet. Try to understand
    if there are specific concerns that are holding people back (e.g. “I don’t trust
    it with my own data”), and share tools or techniques that can help mitigate those
    perceived risks.'

    All Hands, or internal knowledge sharing sessions. You can share ML or AI projects
    you or your team have already implemented. It is important to ensure the right
    level of technical details to allow people to follow your presentation, and highlight
    the project’s potential, impact, and learnings. It can also be interesting to
    share how these projects differentiate from “traditional software development”
    or the other type of projects from the company.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: People around you have already some awareness and sensibility about AI and ML,
    the types of models that exist, their potential, and how those types of projects
    work, great! The next step is to start introducing use cases that can inspire
    projects for your company. These use cases can come from competitors or analogous
    industries, but also from the general use cases that apply to most companies (user
    segmentation, client / user churn prediction, selling forecasts…).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Demonstrating how competitors or other companies are leveraging AI can be powerful
    to illustrate its potential and inspire next steps. When showcasing use cases,
    you can focus on the problem that use case solves, the tangible benefits it achieved,
    and make the analogy on how something similar could be applicable in your company.
    Similarly, for more general use cases, such as user segmentation, it can be interesting
    to showcase the type of application that could come out of it in your specific
    company (dynamic pricing, personalization, improved communications…).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If there are already some teams doing competitors analysis (usually User Researchers),
    make sure they are also taking into account ML / AI features. Help them gain the
    sensibility on how those solutions might work underneath to enrich further their
    research and detect AI opportunities for your company.

    it can help solve in your company. If you’ve done it right, you should have been
    able to get some people really excited about all this potential!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This excitement can translate into people coming directly to you to share other
    use cases, ask questions, or even ask wether something is feasible to solve with
    AI or not. These are your sponsors: champions within the organization who can
    support and advocate for AI initiatives. Depending on the size of the company
    and how big the culture change needs to be, this sponsorship might be close enough
    to influence decision-making at the highest levels. However, getting to inspire
    business stakeholders can also be good enough, as they can push to solve their
    own objectives through AI.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’ve planted the seeds for AI project ideas to come out. You can now start
    proposing specific AI solutions for specific company problems or objectives. Thanks
    to all the previous work on awareness, use cases, and sponsors, these proposals
    should be now much more well received!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What is most interesting from this step though, is waiting for the use cases
    to also come to you. Your AI sponsors and other people in the company are now
    able to link problems and objectives to AI solutions. It might surprise you how
    much use cases can appear from this direction. The awareness you’ve built will
    naturally lead to more informed and relevant suggestions.

    But how do you decide with where to start? It might make sense to start with the

    of AI projects, can be challenging due to their inherent uncertainty. However,
    there are some key points to take into account that can help on that end:'

    traction and build trust. Once that is managed, maybe you can start introducing
    explorative ideas (moonshots) that aim longer term & bigger transformation, but
    also involve higher risks to fail. Balancing a continuous delivery and improvement
    with moonshots is key to maintain the trust long term while also exploring real
    innovation.

    happen overnight. From my experience, it is important to start generating awareness
    and education, showcasing use cases, and aligning with sponsors in the right positions.
    Only then, proposing use cases will listened; even other people might come to
    you with relevant ideas! Once some use cases have been gathered and there is some
    bandwidth and buy-in to prioritize some dedication, it is time to focus on strategic
    problems, quantify well the opportunity and potential, and balance between quick
    wins and long term moonshots.
