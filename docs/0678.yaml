- en: When finding influential nodes in a graph, you can consider graph metrics such
    as centrality or degree, which tell you how influential a single node is. However,
    to find the most influential set of nodes in the graph, you must consider which
    combination of nodes has the highest influence on the graph, which is a challenging
    problem to solve. This article explores how you can approach the issue of choosing
    the most influential set of nodes from a graph.

- en: My motivation for this article is that I am currently working on my thesis,
    which involves semi-supervised clustering. In essence, I have to select some nodes
    from the graph that I can know the label of and then use that information to cluster
    the other nodes. Therefore, finding the most influential set of nodes to know
    the label is essential for the performance of my clustering algorithm. In this
    article’s case, influence over the graph will be regarded as how well the set
    of selected nodes can assist the clustering algorithm. However, this influence
    over the graph can also be generalized to other problems.
