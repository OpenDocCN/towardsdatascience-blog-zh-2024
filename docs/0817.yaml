    on March 27, 2024\. The webinar is also* [*available to watch online*](https://www.assemblymag.com/events/7035-the-future-of-robotic-assembly)*.
    Read this article for free* [*here*](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/the-future-of-robotic-assembly-ce3446703de8?sk=e5d2b10f877383d1146a1d03689b3928)
    *if you are not a Medium subscriber. High-mix, low-volume problems still elude
    robotic automation. Reviewing recent trends in collaborative robotics, artificial
    intelligence, and humanoid robotics, I argue that assembly and disassembly might
    be the killer-app for humanoid robots literally looking for work.*'

- en: Henry Ford is known as the father of mass production, streamlining the production
    of his “Model T” enabling cars to be widespread and affordable. One of the key
    innovations at the time was to use a conveyor belt in the assembly lane that paced
    the production process. Yet, actual labor was mostly manual and still is today,
    for example looking at [engine assembly at BMW in 2024](https://www.bmwgroup-werke.com/en/produktion/engine-assembly.html).

    of the assembly steps, in particular in the engine department and final assembly,
    are still manual.

    time, is indeed a key idea to make an assembly process…
