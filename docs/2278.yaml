    (RDS), Proxy became [generally available in June 2020](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/06/amazon-rds-proxy-generally-available/)
    in RDS for MySQL and PostgreSQL as well as their Aurora-compatible counterparts.
    Proxy facilitates pooling and sharing of database connections, which is valuable
    for serverless applications that need to query RDS databases at scale with managed
    failover. Since June 2020, Proxy has extended support to RDS for MariaDB and SQL
    Server.

- en: RDS Proxy is already served by excellent documentation — [Amazon’s own product
    documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/proxy/) is one useful reading reference.
    This blog post builds on existing material by focusing on lessons learned setting
    up and monitoring a Proxy. These observations come from experience using Proxy
    with Aurora MySQL, but they apply irrespective of the DB engine target.

- en: There are [a few Proxy terms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-proxy.howitworks.html)
    to explain before we dive into lessons learned. Firstly, database (DB) instances
    are called *targets,* and targets are associated with a Proxy *target group*.
    Each target group consists of an individual RDS DB instance or an RDS DB cluster,
    where a cluster has many DB instances. Proxy uses one or more *endpoints* to forward
    queries to target groups.
