- en: To deliver your [Data as a Product](https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-monolith-to-mesh.html#DomainDataAsAProduct),
    rather than just a table or file without further business context, is a key principle
    of the data mesh framework. Considering whether to deliver data as a product through
    an application service (API) or as a pure data structure is an important design
    decision. I’ve previously examined this specific challenge [in part 2 of my three-part
    series on data mesh](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/challenges-and-solutions-in-data-mesh-part-2-7dfe97aa461a).
    However, this post will discuss the issue beyond the data mesh concept, because
    I think it is so fundamental. I will outline the key differences and then argue
    why you should prefer “Data as a Pure Structure” over “Data as an Application.”

- en: The concept of transforming your data into a product isn’t new in the realm
    of data engineering and was used even before the data mesh framework was defined.
    However, there is an important distinction between creating a product powered
    by data and treating the data itself as a product — here is a good explanation
    for the subtle [difference between “Data as a Product” and “Data Product”](/data-as-a-product-vs-data-products-what-are-the-differences-b43ddbb0f123).
    In this post, I focus on “Data as a Product”, even if I also use the term data
    product for brevity.
