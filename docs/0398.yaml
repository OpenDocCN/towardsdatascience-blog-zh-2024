    had the opportunity to work on countless projects of various types. Like many
    Data Scientists, I began to develop a reflex when working with tabular datasets:
    “If it is tabular, feature engineering + a boosting algorithm will do the job!”
    and I wouldn’t ask myself further questions.'

    for so long that it became very difficult to question their supremacy.

    boosting algorithms and, in particular, their core component, the decision trees,
    and understand the scenarios in which you should be particularly careful when
    dealing with Boosting Algorithms facing data drift.

    your data changes over time, which can impact your machine learning models.
