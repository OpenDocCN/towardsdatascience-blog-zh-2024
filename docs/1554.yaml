    a practical approach to achieving this in the data mesh through federated enterprise
    data modeling.

- en: ‘Federated Computational Governance’ ensures a secure, trustworthy, and interoperable
    data mesh. The added value from interoperability is often encapsulated in the
    phrase, “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.” While setting up technical
    aspects like standard protocols (e.g., HTTP), efficient data transport mechanisms,
    and comprehensive versioning of components is crucial to enable interoperability,
    our focus here will be on maintaining overall data consistency and compatibility.

- en: For the data mesh to truly support interoperability, we must ensure a consistent
    and coherent model that encompasses content from all data products. This model
    needs to be dynamically updated with every new data product added. In this final
    article of my three-part series, I will demonstrate a practical approach to maintaining
    this holistic view, keeping it consistent and up-to-date.

- en: '*Governance* often evokes thoughts of rigid rules that may hinder progress.
    It’s seen as burdensome, adding extra work without immediate benefits. Automating
    governance processes (making it ‘computational’) can streamline their application
    within the data mesh, albeit still at a project or product cost.'
