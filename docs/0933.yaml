- en: Code clarity is both a virtue and a necessity. If you write clear and readable
    code, other developers will be able to understand it, users will understand how
    to use it, and even the future you will appreciate it, as with time most of us
    forget details of the code we implement. Code clarity gets more and more important
    with the increasing size of the project and the codebase.

- en: Among programming languages, Python offers very readable code. Or rather, it
    *can* offer very readable code — but you need to know how to make it readable.
    I’d even say that Python gained such popularity for several reasons, an important
    of them being code readability. Hence, it’s our responsibility to write good Python
    code. And for this, we need tools.
