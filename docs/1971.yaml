    Although EDA can process a large historical dataset into a set of useful insights,
    there is a disconnect between the insights and the active decision because they
    only describe my choices by analogy (i.e. if I’m willing to assume the current
    used car market is similar to the past market). Perhaps it would be better to
    call a decision made this way **data-informed** rather than **data-driven**. A
    truly data-driven decision would be based on a dataset that describes the actual

    which makes sense since that was one of the benefit metrics I used in my value
    model. Additionally, with the exception of a couple (delusional) sellers in the
    lower-right of the plot, it’s clear that cars with higher mileage have a lower
    top-end asking price — but perhaps more interestingly, mileage does **not** seem
    to strongly impact low-end asking prices. Even low mileage cars are available
    for cheap!

    screen the dataset to remove high-cost cars because, as I mentioned before, it’s
    considered MATE best practice not to reduce the number of alternatives before
    beginning the Explore layer. But realistically, I have a budget for this purchase
    of $10K, and maybe I want the best car available under that limit — especially
    now that I know I’ll still be able to find a car with low mileage in that price
    range. I’ll add my budget requirement and switch back to a scatterplot:'

- en: The goal of this article was to show how EDA and tradespace exploration are
    similar/complementary but highlight a few key differences in how data is collected
    and visualized when the end goal is to find the “best” point in a dataset. Tradespace
    exploration can be the “one step beyond” EDA that pushes a decision from data-informed
    to truly data-driven. But this short example only scratches the surface of what
    we can do with MATE.
