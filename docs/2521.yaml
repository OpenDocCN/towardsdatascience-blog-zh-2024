    for a game.

    myself) was able to consistently beat it, so much so that I had to make it dumber
    in a controlled way to make it enjoyable for casual players.

    standard techniques from the AI playbook before Deep Learning. You’ll learn (in
    case you are not already familiar with it) how to build Minimax trees and how
    to develop heuristics for board evaluation. The Minimax technique can apply to
    any adversarial game regardless of the specifics of the game I describe here.

    of the iPhone), there were few available board games. And some of the games were
    not really playable on the tiny screens of the time. That was, of course, the
    case of chess: you can’t really display a chessboard in a 3.5-inch display with
    a resolution of 320 x 480 pixels. You can, but it’s going to strain your eyes.'
