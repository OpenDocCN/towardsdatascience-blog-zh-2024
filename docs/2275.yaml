    me through a metal detector, put a bag over my head, and drove me to a shack in
    the woods of rural France. They took my phone, wallet, and passport to ensure
    I wouldn’t spill the beans before finally showing off what they’ve been working
    on.

    asked me not to say anything until a specified time, but as a tech writer the
    mystery had me feeling a little like James Bond.

    engine in Polars that enables GPU accelerated computation, allowing for interactive
    data manipulation of 100GB+ of data. We’ll discuss what a data frame is in polars,
    how GPU acceleration works with polars dataframes, and how much of a boost to
    performance one can expect with the new CUDA powered execution engine.'
