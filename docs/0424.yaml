- en: Creating quality embeddings is an essential part of most AI systems. Embeddings
    are the foundation on which an AI model can do its job, and creating high-quality
    embeddings is, therefore, an important element in making high-accuracy AI models.
    This article will talk about how you can ensure the quality of your embeddings,
    which can help you create better AI models.

- en: First of all, embeddings are information stored as an array of numbers. This
    is typically required when you are using an AI model, as the AI models only accept
    numbers as input, and you cannot for example feed text straight into an AI model
    to do NLP analysis. Creating embeddings can be done with several different approaches
    like autoencoders or from training on downstream tasks. The problem with embeddings
    however is that they are meaningless to the human eye. You cannot judge the quality
    of an embedding by simply looking at the numbers, and measuring the quality of
    the embeddings in general can be a challenging task. Thus, this article will explain
    how you can get an indication of the quality of your embedding, though these…
