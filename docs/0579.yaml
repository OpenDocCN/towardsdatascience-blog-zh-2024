- en: Since the advent of ChatGPT, it has brought tremendous shock to human society.
    Especially for us developers, our lives have been reshaped dramatically because
    of it. ChatGPT can answer all kinds of technical and non-technical questions correctly,
    accurately, and efficiently.

    chats programmatically by implementing it in our application and use it to answer
    customer questions or boost the efficiency of our business in general.

    shops. We used to build machine learning or deep learning models based on the
    product category data we could get. However, these models are limited by the training
    data we can have, no matter how sophisticatedly the models are trained. In comparison,
    with ChatGPT, the models behind the scenes are built on a lot more data than we
    can ever have access to and are also trained with more advanced algorithms. Therefore,
    the predictions by ChatGPT are normally more accurate, even for products we have
    never indexed before.
