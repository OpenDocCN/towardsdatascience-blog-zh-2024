    weather patterns, and time series. The next position of these systems depends
    on the previous state.

    of data as they analyze the input in isolation. They have no understanding that
    the data is indeed sequential.

    work with sequence data. But this is like trying to shove an elephant into a shoebox
    — it just doesn’t really work!'

    for you to check out! I recommend becoming familiar with how these regular neural
    networks work before proceeding with RNNs.
