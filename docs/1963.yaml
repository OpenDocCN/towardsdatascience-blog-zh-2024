- en: 'Traditional AI systems relying on deep artificial neural networks that run
    inside computers require vast amounts of computational resources for their training,
    leading to concerns about their sustainability. One promising avenue to address
    this issue is the development of physical artificial neural networks: systems
    that mimic the structure of biological neural networks more closely than their
    digital counterparts, by using physical ways to make information flow rather than
    concatenating numerical calculations across neurons simulated in a computer. For
    example, in a subclass of physical neural network called “optical neural networks”,
    light waves are emitted and combined to carry out various computations. But these
    physical systems face unique challenges, especially when it comes to training
    them. A recent study just published in *Nature* ([Xue et al *Nature* 632:280–286,
    2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07687-4)) presents a truly groundbreaking
    solution that leverages physics to tackle these challenges. This is a step towards
    a possible future where AI systems run on physical systems hence becoming much
    more manageable, scalable, and…'
