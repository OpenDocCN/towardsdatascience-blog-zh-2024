- en: Can ChatGPT really play chess? This was the question that motivated me to run
    a chess match between ChatGPT and my hybrid AI model, that is a chess expert bot.
    The first game was against GPT 3.5 and in this game I found several limitations
    of the OpenAI LLM model—it was really hard to play the match till its end because
    of the lack of understanding about the rules of chess coming from ChatGPT, many
    illegal moves, and wrong analysis.

    long-term reasoning, and analytical power. By knowing the model’s behavior well,
    we can find ways to resolve its flaws and increase its strengths. As AI engineers,
    we must always set up different experiments to analyze the real behavior of the
    models and plan to adapt and improve it in our projects. Large Language Models
    technology is still very recent and must be increasingly explored and studied
    to ensure its best use and understanding.
