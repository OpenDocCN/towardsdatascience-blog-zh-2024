    Review, 81% of executives believe that AI will be a significant competitive advantage
    for their business). AI & ML projects often have clearer ROI cases, and data teams
    are at the center of this, with an increasing number of machine learning systems
    being powered by the data warehouse.

    give candid, anonymous feedback on questions such as *happiness about self-serve,
    the quality of their dashboards,* and *if there are enough data people in their
    area* (this also gives you some ammunition before asking for headcount)*.*

    back and show meaningful improvements. Make sure to collect data about which business
    area the respondents work in. This will give you some invaluable insights into

    areas, you didn’t know about.

    stakeholders in your area to get buy-in that you should spend your time here insteadof
    one of the hundreds of other things you could be doing. It gives them a transparent
    forum for becoming part of the project and being brought in from the get-go–and
    also a way to shoot down projects early where the opportunity is too small or
    the risk too big.

    are particularly well suited for this. But even if you’re asked to revamp a set

    same principles can make sense.

    for the trees. For example, it may sound impressive that a data analyst can shave
    off $5,000/month by optimizing some of the longest-running queries in dbt. But

    savings is helpful.

    bogged down by implementation details of how hard it was to build, the fancy algorithm
    you used, or how many lines of code you wrote. But stakeholders care little about
    this. Instead, consider this framing.

    not falling for the sunk cost fallacy.
