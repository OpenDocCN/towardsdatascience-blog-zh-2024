- en: Prompts today are the primary mode of interaction with large language models
    (LLMs). Prompts need to be tuned according to the user need, providing the right
    context and guidance to the LLM — to maximize the chances of getting the ‘right’
    response.

- en: It has led to the rise of prompt engineering [1] as a professional discipline,
    where prompt engineers systematically perform trials, recording their findings,
    to arrive at the ‘right’ prompt to elicit the ‘best’ response. The list of such
    successful prompts are then organized in the form of a library such that they
    can be efficiently reused — referred to as a **prompt store**.

- en: Unfortunately, curating and maintaining a high quality prompt store remains
    **challenging**. The overarching goal of a prompt store is to be able to retrieve
    the optimal prompt for a given task, without having to repeat the whole experimentation
    process. However, this retrieval is easier said than done primarily due to the
    **overlapping** nature of prompts.
