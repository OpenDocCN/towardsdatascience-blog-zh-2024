Roll up to the study, grab your “significance meal,” and boom — you’ve got a tasty conclusion to share with all your friends. And it isn’t just convenient for the reader, it makes researchers’ lives easier too. Why make the hard sell when you can say two words instead?</p><p id="747e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">But there’s a catch.</p><p id="1570" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Those fancy equations and nitty-gritty details we’ve conveniently avoided? They’re the real meat of the matter. And when researchers and readers rely too heavily on one statistical tool, we can end up making a whopper of a mistake, like the one that nearly broke the laws of physics.</p><p id="a1c0" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">In 2011, physicists at the renowned CERN laboratory announced a shocking discovery: <a class="af nc" href="https://www.science.org/content/article/neutrinos-travel-faster-light-according-one-experiment" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">neutrinos could travel faster than the speed of light</a>. The finding threatened to overturn Einstein’s theory of relativity, a cornerstone of modern physics. The researchers were confident in their results, passing physics’ rigorous statistical significance threshold of 99.9999998%. Case closed, right?</p><p id="b60d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Not quite. As other scientists scrutinized the experiment, they found flaws in the methodology and ultimately <a class="af nc" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna46760561" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">could not replicate the results</a>. The original finding, despite its impressive “statistical significance,” turned out to be false.</p><p id="714f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">In this article, we’ll delve into four critical reasons why you shouldn’t instinctively trust a statistically significant finding.

Think about that for a second. Something that is generally thought of as an objective measure is, at its core, entirely subjective.</p><p id="063a" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">The mathematical part is provided one step before deciding on the significance, via a numerical measure of confidence. The most common form used in <a class="af nc" href="https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/hypothesis-testing/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">hypothesis testing</a> is called the <a class="af nc" href="https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/p-value/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">p-value</a>. This provides the actual mathematical probability that the test data results were not simply due to randomness.</p><p id="fbd9" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">For example, a p-value of 0.05 means there’s a 5% chance of seeing these data points (or more extreme) due to random chance, or that we are 95% confident the result wasn’t due to chance. For example, suppose you believe a coin is unfair in favour of heads i.e. the probability of landing on heads is greater than 50%. You toss the coin 5 times and it lands on heads each time. There’s a 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 3.1% chance that it happened simply because of chance, if the coin was fair.</p><p id="171c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">But is this enough to say it’s statistically significant? It depends who you ask.</p><p id="e636" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Often, whoever is in charge of determining where the line of significance will be drawn in the sand has more influence on whether a result is significant than the underlying data itself.</p><p id="ffa7" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Given this subjective final step, often in my own analysis I’d provide the reader of the study with the level of confidence percentage, rather than the binary significance/non-significance result.

So, roughly speaking, you have a 1% chance of making it as a professor if you have completed a PhD and want to make academia your career.

What they all have in common is they’re heavily focused on citations i.e. how many times has their published work been mentioned in other published work.
