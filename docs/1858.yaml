- en: As an experienced data professional working in the tech industry for many years,
    I have processed tons of large datasets. SQL is the most frequently used tool
    for data manipulation, data query, and analysis. Although mastering basic and
    intermediate SQL is relatively easy, achieving mastery of this tool and wielding
    it adeptly in diverse scenarios is sometimes challenging. There are a few advanced
    SQL techniques that you must be familiar with if you want to work for top tech
    companies. Today, I’ll share the most useful advanced SQL techniques that you’ll
    undoubtedly use in your work. To help you understand them better, I’ll create
    some use cases and use mock data to explain the scenarios in which to use them
    and how to use them. For each use case, programming code will also be provided.
