    (RMBL) thanks to a fellowship from the [Rady School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://western.edu/school/paul-m-rady-school-of-computer-science-engineering/),
    a partner of the [University of Colorado](http://www.colorado.edu). Along with
    us, we brought a [Unitree Go-1](https://shop.unitree.com/products/unitreeyushutechnologydog-artificial-intelligence-companion-bionic-companion-intelligent-robot-go1-quadruped-robot-dog?_gl=1*6jvrzo*_up*MQ..&gclid=CjwKCAjwkJm0BhBxEiwAwT1AXCLtkvwwRL5Pek6hnJRp_vv3RmIyidPbY_DSSewnUt6CH7tQaEgR0hoCFS0QAvD_BwE)
    from the [Collaborative AI and Robotics Lab](https://www.cairo-lab.com/) at CU
    Boulder. RMBL scientists are not only biologists, but many have become drone operators,
    sensor engineers and data scientists. Our goal is to find out what a commodity
    robotic dog can add to their set of tools, what it can actually accomplish in
    the field, and what fundamental research in robotics is needed to enable them.
