    Pandas operations — but to be honest, I will write about fun.

    my 20+ years of experience in data science, I’ve found that the more enjoyment
    I derive from coding, the more satisfied I am from completing the task. And I
    do mean the process of pursuing the task, not only just completing it. Of course,
    achieving results matters, probably the most. But trust me, if you dislike the
    tools you’re using, all you’ll want is to finish the job as quickly as possible.
    This can lead to mistakes, as you might work hastily and overlook important details
    in the data. And that’s something you want to avoid.

    thanks to the `dplyr` syntax. I’ve always enjoyed it, and I still do. However,
    when I switched to Python, I found myself preferring it over R. I’ve never really
    enjoyed programming in R (note the distinction between analyzing data and programming),
    while…
