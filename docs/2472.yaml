- en: For those who may not know, NotebookLM is a personalized AI research assistant
    powered by Gemini 1.5 Pro, designed to make sense of complex information. In addition
    to answering questions based on your uploaded sources (documents, slides, charts,
    etc.), it can also create personalized study materials by automatically generating
    things like a table of contents, study guides, briefing documents, FAQs, and more.
    While it formulates answers based on the uploaded sources, it also provides inline
    citations, highlighting the specific text blocks in the source documents used
    to generate the response.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The uploaded content can range from research papers and meeting transcripts
    to quotes from interesting books, chapters of a novel you’re writing, corporate
    documents, and more. These sources can include Google Docs, Slides, PDFs, text
    files, copied text, and even web pages.

- en: 'Now, to the main reason for this article: Last month, [NotebookLM announced
    a new feature](https://blog.google/technology/ai/notebooklm-audio-overviews/)
    — Audio Overviews — which has been making headlines. This feature offers a new
    way to interact with your source documents. With just one click, it generates
    engaging “deep dive” discussions that summarize the key topics in your sources.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What’s even more impressive is how it transforms any piece of content, no matter
    how dry, by generating two AI hosts (one male and one female) who discuss the
    document’s contents in a podcast-style format.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you’re wondering what “podcast-style format” means, imagine the friendly
    banter, the little jokes, the back-and-forth conversations, the laughs, interruptions,
    “umms,” and “you knows’”— essentially all the hallmarks of a great podcast listening
    experience.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    your text, resulting in an engaging dialogue.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To test it out, I decided to repurpose one of my [old Medium articles](https://medium.com/trusted-data-science-haleon/challenges-in-implementing-gen-ai-products-7e4659f84096)
    and create a podcast from it to cater to a more audio-loving audience.

    your Google ID if you aren’t already. If it’s your first visit, you’ll see several
    sample notebooks and you can create a new one with the “Create” button.

    Medium article. Alternatively, you can paste text or fetch from Google Drive.

- en: It’s remarkable that we can quickly create a podcast episode in just minutes,
    allowing many of us to have a side gig as podcasters (should you choose to). This
    is a great way for writers to repurpose their content and for others to engage
    with relatively complex topics in a fun and accessible manner.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The use of analogies throughout the audio is truly remarkable and captivating.
    In the case of my Medium article, it was able to take a relatively niche (read:boring)
    topic (scaling challenges with Gen AI might not appeal to everyone outside the
    immediate field) and make connections to everyday things.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For instance, at one point the hosts discuss Gen AI token costs and provide
    a much more relatable example, comparing how these costs can add up to micro-transactions
    in a mobile game. Similarly, they explain prompt engineering with an example of
    providing a complete recipe with measurements, rather than simply saying “make
    me a delicious meal”. They also use the analogy of a car remembering a common
    route to explain LLM caching.
  prefs:

- en: The way the two hosts build on each other’s sentences feels very natural, and
    the segues flow seamlessly. For example, using phrases like “speaking of…” to
    introduce a new topic feels organic and not forced at all.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Emphasis on certain words at just the right moments helps hold the listeners’
    attention. Expressions like “oh wow”, “oops”, and “aah” convey genuine surprise
    at what the other host just said. Natural pauses to think of the right word make
    the conversation feel spontaneous rather than rehearsed.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After testing this on several deep learning papers, I can confidently say it
    will be a game changer for explaining complex research that benefits from analogies
    and “explain like I’m five” (ELI5) examples. In fact, the guidelines in one of
    their pre-prepared example notebooks, titled *Introduction to NotebookLM*, state
    that it’s designed for researchers, journalists, students, and business professionals.

- en: 'Having looked at the key advantages, there are also a few limitations to consider:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, the conversation between the two hosts doesn’t feel real. Very often,
    they finish each other’s sentences, even when the first host has just asked the
    second host to explain a new concept and a few seconds later, Host 1 ends up answering
    their own question.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Not all input sources generate audio of equal quality. As part of stress testing,
    I tried inputting the transcript from another podcast, and the hosts seemed more
    inclined to make humorous noises at each other — ‘yayaya,’ ‘oh yeah,’ ‘hmm,’ ‘uh-huh,’
    ‘right,’ ‘gotcha,’ etc.!
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The only downside to having a lot of analogies while discussing a topic is that
    *sometimes* the AI can get the analogies wrong. For instance, while discussing
    a blog on forecasting metrics, it used the analogy of “just like in schools a
    lower score is generally better, it means your forecast is closer to reality”.

- en: Such hallucinations are common across different generative AI models and have
    been included as a disclaimer in their tool as well. These might be more pronounced
    if we provide a very niche, highly specialized topic, such as the role of microRNAs
    in gene regulation (the topic that won the Nobel Prize in 2024 this week). In
    such cases, it may start hallucinating with analogies used due to a lack of relevant
    inherent knowledge🤷‍♀.
  prefs:
  - PREF_IND
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For very large texts, the podcast can often end abruptly. This suggests that
    there may be a cutoff point for the training data, beyond which the audio cannot
    adapt to provide a smooth, natural ending.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: (Very minor but) Some of the words, mostly abbreviations, are garbled in the
    audio. For some reason RAG is pronounced as ArrrR-G instead of individual alphabets
    like R-A-G.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At times, hosts overly agree with one another, using filler words like ‘right’
    and ‘exactly’ while the other host is still talking. This can feel like forced
    responses; I mean, let the poor guy finish!

    question: is this new tech enough to give podcasters a serious competition?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My simple answer is — not yet. The reason? All the aforementioned issues we’ve
    discussed. And I know some of you might disagree and say these problems are minor,
    and you’d be right. If you listen to just one podcast, you may not even notice
    them, but if you continuously listen to multiple episodes, especially on a daily
    or weekly basis, the sheer number of analogies and “*exactlys*” can become overwhelming.
    For these reasons, perhaps Google never positioned it as a podcasting tool in
    their initial release.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That said, it will definitely lower the barrier to entry for many who want to
    explore this field but may not want to use their own voice for various reasons.
    More importantly, I see its use as a way to consume complex topics in digestible
    formats.

    Personally, the positives definitely outweigh the negatives, and I can see how
    this technology could be a game changer in fields like medical research, legal
    briefs, or even onboarding guides for businesses — essentially, anything with
    dull text that could benefit from some enhancement for an auditory audience.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That said, there are a few things I’m looking forward to with future releases.
    First and foremost, an API that would allow me to bypass the UI and quickly integrate
    it with my other tools. Second, I’d like the capability to adjust the length of
    the output audio, and finally, an option to customize the context/theme (and quantity)
    of the analogies to better cater to my interests. For instance, if I’m a video
    game enthusiast, I’d appreciate analogies related to gaming mechanics, whereas
    if I’m a chef, I’d prefer analogies tied to culinary techniques.

    information. If you’ve tried it, I’d love to hear your thoughts!
