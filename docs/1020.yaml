    (ML) project meeting where an ML engineer or data scientist reports on the time
    consumed by writing unit tests for code that may be already in a production phase.
    But let’s pause and think about what unit tests are actually for. Here’s a definition:
    A unit test is a block of code that verifies the accuracy of a smaller, isolated
    portion of the application code, typically a function or method. It’s designed
    to ensure that this piece of code functions as expected, in line with the developer’s
    initial design, requirements, and logic.'

- en: 'The core idea: ensuring that “the block of code runs as expected”, is nothing
    new. Software developers have long embraced unit testing, often implementing these
    tests even before writing the actual code. However, ML engineers and data scientists
    often have a different background and approach. Their primary goal is to build
    mappings from an input X to a target Y, utilizing statistical methods, mathematics,
    and a range of pre-built libraries like SciKit Learn. But consider…'
