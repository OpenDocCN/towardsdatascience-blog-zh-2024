- en: This is the first article in a [larger series](https://shawhin.medium.com/list/full-stack-data-science-f0910c75d006)
    on “Full Stack Data Science” (FSDS). Although there are distinct roles for different
    aspects of a machine learning (ML) project, there is often a need for someone
    who can **manage and implement projects end-to-end**. This is what we can call
    a full-stack data scientist. In this article, I will introduce FSDS and discuss
    its 4 *Hats*.

- en: When I first learned data science (5+ years ago), data engineering and ML engineering
    were not as widespread as they are today. Consequently, the role of a data scientist
    was often **more broadly defined** than what we may see these days.

    performed feature engineering, trained ML models, and deployed models into production.

    (e.g., data engineers, data scientists, and ML engineers), many situations still
    call for contributors who are **well-versed in all aspects of ML**…
