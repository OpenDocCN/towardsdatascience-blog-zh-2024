    of astronomical observation by Johannes Kepler from which he derived his laws
    of planetary motion. Both physics and data science extract patterns from data,

    because it threads through classical and quantum mechanics. It forms an alternative
    though equivalent formulation to the classical equations of motion invented by
    Newton for describing the evolution of a physical system. Specifically, it describes
    the motion of a physical system in time by determining the path that minimizes
    something called *the action*. The action is a functional, namely a function that
    takes functions as inputs, that describes the path of the system as stationary
    with respect to path variations between two points. Understanding the action as
    a functional, specifically as scoring the path variations, is key to understanding
    the concept behind it. The specifics of this will become clearer in the exposition
    below. This remarkable result articulates motion as a type of optimization function
    within given constraints.

    into a unified metric that enables their measurements to proportionally change
    relative to observers in inertial frames of reference while conserving the speed
    of light. This formalism ensures that the speed of light remains constant across
    frames of reference, contrary to Newtonian assumptions that would have the speed
    of light change against invariable units of space and time. Before the theory
    of special relativity, the constancy of the speed of light was an experimentally
    observed phenomenon that did not fit into the framework of classical physics.

    length or distance in curved spaces. The metric tensor is a bilinear, symmetric
    identity matrix that generalizes the Pythagorean theorem underlying flat, Euclidean
    space to any possible space including curved surfaces. Curved surfaces were used
    by Einstein to describe the distortion of spacetime in the presence of gravity.
    As data scientists, you’re likely very familiar with the Euclidean distance and
    linear algebra so appreciating the concepts behind the metric tensor should be
    a natural step. The metric tensor developed by Bernhard Riemann forms the foundation
    of non-Euclidean geometry and remarkably generalizes the notion of *length* to
    any underlying geometry.

    energy? Because as the system moves it converts potential energy into kinetic
    and the difference between the two captures the dynamic interplay between these
    two types of energy. It is important to note conversely that the total energy

    a curved plane and you need to find the shortest distance. There are many paths
    between the two points, but only one path or line that represents the shortest
    distance. The action is analogous to this problem. In order to find the trajectory
    of the system, we need to select a path that minimizes the action. A corollary
    of this is that the action stays stationary through the evolution of the system.

    point t₀ to t₁ is typically understood as the area under the curve, the path integral
    of the Lagrangian should not be intuitively thought of as an area, but rather
    the integration of a functional, which is a function that takes another function(s)
    as input and outputs a scalar. The input will be the Lagrangian. The output defines
    the action. Across the many paths the system could take between t₀ and t₁, we

    a continuous interval between t₀ and t₁, even though it can also be computed in

    If you recall back to Galilean relativity, the interchangeability of inertial
    frames of reference is achieved through rotations. Rotations are described by

    the Euclidean metric, the spacetime metric makes all spatiotemporal transformations
    relative to the speed of light as an absolute value. For this reason, the speed
    of light forms an asymptote that Lorentz transformations approach but cannot equal.
    In the spacetime diagram the speed of light is denoted by the equalities **x =
    ct** and **x’ = ct’**. If you recall back to our spacetime diagram, the asymptotes
    consist of the diagonals cutting across both axes. Since the range of spacetime

    functions but that use hyperbolas instead of circles. Unlike circles which are
