- en: Road networks are beautiful bird-eye view representations of cities. However,
    their importance reaches far beyond eye candies used as wallpapers. In fact, for
    the trained urbanist eyes, the visual structure of a city’s road network already
    hints at lots of information about the masterplan (if there was any) and the possible
    paths of development a city took, as well as the potential pitfalls and problems
    currently, or in the near future could affect the city. These can range from public
    and private transportation planning to the improvement of green infrastructure
    and the accessibility of services and amenities.

    the [OSMnx](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library to download various
    global cities road networks.
