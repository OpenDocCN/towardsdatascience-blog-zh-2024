  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although I’m not religious, the principle of having a nice and even number of
    rules is fascinating. Therefore, here you find a rule set of ten rules for creating
    reporting solutions.
  prefs: []

    formulate the rules in the most generic way possible.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to the client, stakeholders, or users is: What questions do you want to answer
    with the new solution?'

    the answer.

  prefs: []

    save you from failure or doing more work than expected.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2\. You shall know the data
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before loading, we should analyze the data to understand its structure and patterns.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We should find the possible hierarchies, key columns, and, most importantly,
    the candidates for the key columns, which we can use for relationships.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moreover, we should check for non-matching and missing keys in the relationships
    between the tables.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is much easier if the data comes as one large table, as there wouldn’t
    be any relationships if we left it that way. But more on this in the fourth commandment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 3\. You shall manipulate your data as soon as possible
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Usually, we must manipulate the data when loading them into our reporting tool
    of choice.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Regardless of the tool, we must perform these manipulations as early as possible.
  prefs: []

    database.

    the data in the cleanest way possible.
  prefs:

    when using Power BI, do it in Power Query.
  prefs:

    tables.
  prefs:

    impossible or too complicated.

    business logic.

    Dimension tables (Figure by the Author)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'In case you don’t know this approach, here is a short introduction:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A Star Schema consists of at least one Fact table. The Fact table sits at the
    center and contains columns for all measurable values. For example, it can be
    a value of money or a count of units. Additionally, it contains so-called Foreign
    keys to Dimension tables.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A Fact table contains a list of Events. An event can be a transaction, a measurement,
    or a booking for a travel trip.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Dimension tables contain a Primary Key and descriptive data, such as data about
    customers, products, stores, etc.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Fact table is linked to the Dimension table through the Key columns.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you can see in the drawing above, each Star Schema contains at least one
    Date table. A Date table has a list of Dates. Each event in the Fact table is
    assigned to a Date.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If events must be analyzed at the hour or minute level, a Time table is needed,
    which contains a list of hours, minutes, and even seconds, if necessary.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The advantage of Dimension tables is that one person or a group can concentrate
    on one Dimension while others can work on another. For example, the Product team
    works on the Product Dimension, while the Customer Center works on the Customer
    Dimension.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This way, the most competent people can concentrate on their competence to deliver
    the best possible result.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you can see, the Geography Dimension is linked to the Store and the Customer
    Dimension.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While this can make sense from a Database perspective and for reducing redundancies,
    this can lead to issues when trying to analyze the data by the store geography
    and the Customer Geography at the same time. Moreover, depending on the tool,
    this can need additional coding as both relationships cause ambiguity in the data
    model (The Fact table is reachable from the Geography table from both the Customer
    and the Store Dimension).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One solution is to copy all needed attributes from the Geography Dimension to
    both tables, Store and Customer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although this causes data redundancy, it makes life easier for reporting.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, it is easier for the data model user, for example, the Report
    Designer or a Data Analyst, to understand which Country attribute is tied to the
    Store or the Customer.

    questions?”

    users: How can I create my own reports or data analysis?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I need to build the data model beyond the technical requirements to fulfill
    this request. I must consider the users’ requirements and, more importantly, their
    capabilities, habits, and points of view.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This brings me back to the fourth commandment: Build a star schema.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This approach is advantageous because it separates the descriptive data from
    the transactions and business events, which makes it easier to search for specific
    attributes.
  prefs: []
