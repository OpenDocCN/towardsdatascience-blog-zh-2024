- en: Causal inference is an emerging field within machine learning that can move
    beyond predicting what could happen to explaining why it will happen and it doing
    so offers the promise of permanently resolving the underlying problem rather than
    dealing with the potential fallout.

- en: Solving causal inference problems requires a visualisation of the cause-and-effect
    factors in a “Directed Acyclic Graph” or DAG which is typically developed by domain
    experts who have built up an informed view of the causality in a system or process.

- en: A challenge with this approach is that the views of the domain experts can be
    flawed or biased and without an accurate DAG the results and outputs of causal
    models will be inaccurate and hence ineffective and the process of ensuring the
    DAG accurately represents the causality is called causal validation.
