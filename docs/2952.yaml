    can own, leaders and decision-makers are always looking for effective ways to
    put their data insights to use. Every time customers interact with digital products,
    millions of data points are generated and the opportunity loss of not harnessing
    these data points to make better products, optimize revenue generation, and improve
    customer footprint is simply too high to ignore. The role of “Data Translators”
    began to emerge in analytics and data science job boards in the 2010s to help
    bridge the knowledge gap between business and Data teams and enable organizations
    to be better and more data-informed. Over the last decade, this role has evolved
    and absorbed more and more facets of data-driven decision-making and has been
    providing much-needed context and translation for business leadership. This role
    also plays an important role in interfacing with stakeholder groups such as Marketing,
    Product, and Strategy to help make all decisions data-centric. With the well-accepted
    importance of this role and the nimble nature of the set of responsibilities assigned
    to it, it is essential for all data practitioners to build the “data translation”
    muscle to excel, succeed, and progress in their roles and career paths.

    all industries. Peter Drucker, the notable Management Theory and Practice expert
    famously said “Every decision is risky: it is a commitment of present resources
    to an uncertain and unknown future.” In most Modern organizations, data centricity
    and data-informed decision-making have been agreed upon as proven ways to have
    reduced risk and ambiguity and business decisions to have a higher likelihood
    of successful outcomes. Data and marketing executives are tasked with making a
    series of decisions each day that have far-reaching impacts on an organization’s
    day-to-day operations and long-term priorities. While data resources are abundant
    in the current landscape, the process of utilizing these resources is still a
    struggle. According to a recent study released by Oracle titled “The Decision
    Dilemma” (April 2023), 72% of business leaders have expressed that the enormous
    volume of data available and the lack of trust and inconsistencies in data sources
    have stopped them from making decisions and 89% believe that the growing number
    of data sources has limited the success of their organizations, despite understanding
    that decisions that are not backed by data can less accurate, less successful
    and more prone to errors.'

    set of decision models based on data and statistical principles was proposed in
    1953 by Irwin D.J Bross distinguishing between the real and symbolic valid and
    illustrating the importance of measurements and validation. And organizations
    have consistently evolved over the past few decades to make data investments and
    have crafted strategies to make data, the center of their risk mitigation and
    decision-making efforts. Despite having these resources, organizations currently
    struggle with the unique problem of balancing the appetite for high-quality actionable
    insights and the availability of resources. A simple “Seesaw” analogy can be used
    to describe these business circumstances. An excessive appetite for knowledge
    and actionable insights combined with inadequate data resources may result in
    Data leaders relying on past decisions, anecdotal evidence, and gut feelings to
    make decisions. On the other hand, an abundance of data resources combined with
    less appetite for knowledge can ultimately result in unnecessary data solutions
    and too many self-serve dashboards being built with no clear strategy to make
    these resources useful.

    despite the availability of abundant data resources. We are increasingly observing
    a unique situation of a Broken Seesaw, where both Data resources and appetite
    for knowledge exist, but owing to the lack of efforts to translate the value that
    the data teams provide to business leaders, both sides of the seesaw get overloaded,
    eventually leading to broken and inefficient decision making processes in the
    long run. Valuable data creates impact, everything else sleeps in a dashboard.

    insights and delivery, as organizations recognize the importance of equipping
    employees with the skills to understand and utilize data effectively. The movement
    gained momentum with research highlighting a significant skills gap among business
    professionals when it comes to interpreting data. The emphasis on training users
    to interpret data can sometimes overlook the steep learning curve that is required
    to build the skill of critically thinking about data evidence and interpreting
    them in a way that aids in risk mitigation.

    and business stakeholders. We can break this bottleneck down into two parts. Firstly,
    an insufficient analytics tool stack for data analysis can hinder effective data
    utilization and communication by non-super users of data. Secondly, the lack of
    training on their use can often lead to misinterpretation and misalignment with
    other data sources hence hindering the chance to establish a single source of
    truth. This eventually affects the credibility of the data teams.

- en: A significant drawback of the current emphasis on data literacy is the tendency
    to place undue blame on users for the shortcomings of data initiatives. When data
    products fail to deliver value or are met with resistance, the reflexive response
    is often to assume a lack of user skill or understanding. This perspective overlooks
    the critical role that business literacy and business context play in effectively
    communicating the data insights whether it is proving or disproving business hypotheses.
    Data literacy is a two-way street. Oftentimes, it is the responsibility of the
    data team members to view the task from the business perspective and understand
    why they would care about what the data team has to say. Acknowledging and addressing
    these shortcomings and aligning data initiatives with business goals can lead
    to more effective and harmonious data-driven cultures.

- en: One solution that the data industry has adopted to address this data and knowledge
    gap and the shortcomings of data literacy efforts is the introduction of “Data
    Translator” roles within organizations. The role of a data translator has evolved
    significantly over the years, reflecting changes in how organizations utilize
    data analytics. Initially emerging as a bridge between data scientists and business
    units, the role was designed to ensure that complex data insights were translated
    into actionable business strategies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the early stages, data translators were primarily seen as intermediaries
    who could communicate technical findings to non-technical stakeholders, helping
    to prioritize business problems and ensuring that analytics solutions were aligned
    with business goals. As the demand for data-driven decision-making grew, so did
    the importance of this role. By 2019, the role had become more prevalent, with
    about a third of companies having positions fitting the data translator description.
    The responsibilities expanded to include not only communication but also ensuring
    that analytics tools were adopted across enterprises and that data democratization
    was achieved. Recently, there has been a shift towards integrating these roles
    into broader functions such as Data Product Owners, reflecting an evolution towards
    more holistic roles that encompass both technical and strategic responsibilities.
    This evolution highlights the ongoing need for roles that can effectively link
    data insights with business outcomes.

    the provided data solutions to the business audience. Professionals who are hired
    in-house typically take the form of either dedicated Data Translator resources,
    Data Product Managers, or Analytics Delivery Managers with the responsibility
    of ensuring that the Data team’s efforts are utilized appropriately for critical
    business decisions. Despite having various job titles, Data Translators are tasked

    often involves identifying projects that not only leverage the team’s skills but
    also have the potential to influence strategic outcomes. A popular approach to
    prioritization is using a framework that assesses the potential impact and feasibility
    of projects. By streamlining the data team’s intake systems and focusing on initiatives
    that promise significant returns or solve critical business problems, data teams
    can maximize their usefulness and productivity. In an article explaining the traits
    of data product managers and translators, Harvard Business Review identified business
    context, broad technical fluency, project management skills, an entrepreneurial
    spirit, and the ability to explain data needs and strategy to the rest of the

    Translators often accomplish this by using a project management technique called
    the “Interest — Influence Matrix”. This process begins by mapping stakeholders
    across two dimensions: their level of interest in data initiatives and their influence
    on decision-making. High-interest and high-influence stakeholders are considered
    key players and should be prioritized for regular communication and collaboration.
    Building strong relationships with these individuals is crucial, as they can champion
    data projects, help secure resources, and remove roadblocks. For less influential
    stakeholders, maintaining periodic contact ensures they remain informed without
    overextending team resources. This type of thoughtful engagement enables data
    teams to focus their efforts where they can have the most significant impact,

    specialized knowledge assumes that others share that same knowledge. This bias
    makes it difficult for knowledgeable individuals to imagine what it’s like to
    lack their expertise. Assuming everyone shares the same understanding and background
    knowledge leads to misunderstandings, wrong assumptions and ineffective communication.
    This is particularly true when interfacing with teams such as Marketing and Product,
    where the stakeholders are not necessarily data fluent, but data plays a major
    role in their projects and campaigns being efficient and fruitful. A data translator
    must have the unique capability to dissect the problem statement and map it into
    data points available, make the connections, find answers, and explain it to stakeholders
    in plain English. Here is a Marketing Analytics example:'

    business questions limits the insights to a specific problem while focusing on
    the overall business outcome gives a chance for both the Data and Business teams
    to look at data insights at a more holistic level. Data Literacy goes hand in
    hand with Business literacy. Data Translators are always expected to have a working
    knowledge of the business outcomes so they can tie insights to the overarching
