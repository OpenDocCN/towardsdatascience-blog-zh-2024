whether they’re putting in place a machine learning model, fixing a major bug, or creating scalable data pipelines. And now with GenAI? Forget it: the bar’s risen even higher.</p><p id="2545" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">But here’s the thing. The average office person only truly works for <a class="af nc" href="https://www.inc.com/betsy-mikel/youre-really-only-productive-for-this-many-hours-in-an-8-hour-workday-study-finds.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">less than 4 hours a day</a>. Yes, you read that right. We’re at our desks for eight or more hours, but a lot of that time is spent on things that aren’t related to work, like scrolling through social media and talking with coworkers. Even when we try to focus, it’s not always easy with all the constant distractions we are exposed to.</p><p id="b344" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">You might be able to relate. You’ve <a class="af nc" href="https://medium.com/towards-data-science/the-one-mindset-change-that-launched-me-into-data-science-3f72bd1df46f" rel="noopener">aligned your passion with your skills</a>. Though it improved your productivity, it didn’t solve everything. Then you explored every technique — from the Pomodoro approach to napping. Despite your best efforts, you still find yourself procrastinating or not satisfied with your level of productivity</p><p id="f39b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">I found myself in a similar situation. I was constantly annoyed that it was so hard for me to concentrate for a long time. Then, I adopted two simple habits that increased my productivity by more than 50%. Not only are these habits easy to implement, but they work perfectly for data scientists or anyone who spends long hours in front of a computer.</p><h1 id="00e3" class="nz oa fq bf ob oc od gq oe of og gt oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou bk">Find activities to unplug and recharge</h1><blockquote class="ov ow ox"><p id="76e7" class="nd ne oy nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">“<a class="af nc" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Without music, life would be a mistake</a>.”</p><p id="83e4" class="nd ne oy nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">— Friedrich Nietzsche</p></blockquote><p id="aff5" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Albert Einstein is recognized as one of the most famous scientists ever. In 1905, at age 26, he had his <a class="af nc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annus_mirabilis_papers" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><em class="oy">annus mirabilis</em></a><em class="oy"> </em>(miraculous year)<em class="oy">. </em>In one year only, he published four groundbreaking papers that had a substantial impact on modern physics.

During an <a class="af nc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagination#cite_note-58" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> with <em class="oy">The Saturday Evening Post</em> in 1929, he famously said, “<a class="af nc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagination#cite_note-58" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.</a>” He believed in intuition and inspiration.

He enjoyed long walks, sailing, and playing the violin. These activities gave him a chance to relax and free his mind. It was often during these moments that he found his best ideas and inspirations.</p><p id="d6d8" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">He came up with some of his best ideas, like special relativity, while he imagined himself <a class="af nc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%27s_thought_experiments#Pursuing_a_beam_of_light" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">chasing after a beam of light</a>. He later recalled, in his <a class="af nc" href="https://archive.org/stream/EinsteinAutobiography/EinsteinAutobiography_djvu.txt" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><em class="oy">Autobiographical Notes</em></a>, that the thought experiment had played an important role in his development of special relativity.</p><p id="aab5" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">The list goes on.</p><p id="39c1" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk"><a class="af nc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Charles Darwin</a> had a daily ritual where he would walk along a gravel path he called his “thinking path” at Down House.

His fascination with birds and their ability to fly led him to study the mechanics of flight in great detail, resulting in his sketches of ornithopters, a flying device.</p><figure class="mm mn mo mp mq mr mj mk paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="ms mt ed mu bh mv"><div class="mj mk oz"><img src="../Images/84e54bcd172bc6945b5c7d5860b71070.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/0*j_mciLecWMnFWr_P"/></div></div><figcaption class="mx my mz mj mk na nb bf b bg z dx">Photo by <a class="af nc" href="https://unsplash.com/@cristina_gottardi?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Cristina Gottardi</a> on <a class="af nc" href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Unsplash</a>.</figcaption></figure><p id="444c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">I know what you’re thinking: “I don’t have time for hobbies. I’m overwhelmed with fine-tuning my latest model and project deadlines!” Trust me, I felt the same way. I used to believe that the more I worked, the more I would accomplish. Like Einstein, da Vinci and Darwin, data scientists engage in intense intellectual work. And just like Einstein playing his violin or Darwin walking his “thinking path," we all need those moments to unplug.</p><p id="ee49" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">After engaging in activities we enjoy, we are more relaxed and feel recharged. We are more efficient in what we do. We bring new perspectives to our work that we wouldn’t have if we just kept working long hours.</p><p id="d9c0" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">You don’t need to start a 2-hour-a-day hobby right away. Even if it’s only 30, 20, or even 10 minutes, it’s a good start. For me, spending at least 30 minutes a day on something that disconnects me from work is ideal. What’s important is that you start somewhere.</p><p id="e397" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">The work of a data scientist is challenging. Analyzing large datasets and building complex models requires long and focused hours in front of the computer. For that reason, ideally you want something that gets you away from the computer screen.</p><p id="59b4" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Engage in an activity that makes you completely disconnected, where you don’t think about anything else. Think about an activity that makes you feel completely recharged after doing it (or almost), even if it doesn’t fully disconnect you in the moment.</p><p id="2a1c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">The activities that make me disconnect the most are rock climbing and outdoor activities. I can’t think about anything else while I’m climbing; otherwise, I might fall. I feel recharged after a rock climbing session, even if it’s a small one or I’m in a rush.</p><p id="3ab7" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Additionally, being strict about my hobbies is essential. It’s non-negotiable. It’s part of my weekly routine. I climb between three to four times a week after work and during the weekend. Even my trips are organized around outdoor activities.</p><p id="7e57" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">It’s not just a hobby; it’s a necessity. I’m at my best when I prioritize this activity, and it allows me to recharge effectively.</p><h1 id="4bbe" class="nz oa fq bf ob oc od gq oe of og gt oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou bk">Cultivate mental strength</h1><blockquote class="ov ow ox"><p id="f3b9" class="nd ne oy nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">“<a class="af nc" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Laozi" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Mastering others is strength; mastering yourself is true power</a>.”</p><p id="7d2d" class="nd ne oy nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">— Lao Tzu</p></blockquote><p id="69f3" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Jensen Huang co-founded NVIDIA in 1993 with the vision of creating groundbreaking technology in graphics processing.

From training AI models to powering autonomous vehicles and cloud-based AI services, NVIDIA’s GPUs have become the industry standard. These decisions have propelled NVIDIA to become one of the largest companies in the world by market capitalization.</p><p id="bbab" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">At the <a class="af nc" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEg8cOx7UZk" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">2024 SIEPR Economic Summit</a>, Huang was asked, “What advice would you give to Stanford students to improve their chances of success?” Instead of the usual “follow your dreams” answer, he emphasized the importance of resilience. Greatness comes from facing challenges. He even humorously wished the students “ample doses” of pain and suffering to shape their character.</p><p id="2e6e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Huang’s main point? Success is not just about being smart. It’s also the ability to recover from setbacks that truly makes a difference. This emphasis on resilience highlights the importance of mental strength in achieving success.</p><p id="ae39" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">In the fast-paced tech industry, being smart and having the right skills are important, but they’re not enough.

Psychological flexibility involves the ability to stay present, open up to difficult experiences, and do what matters in alignment with one’s values—all crucial components of mental strength.</p><p id="c6c5" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">I’m doing what I love, the thing that I must do. I’m passionate about my work, but am I tired sometimes or less motivated? Yes. Do I truly enjoy rock climbing in my free time? Do I know it’s the right sport for me? Yes. But am I sometimes less motivated even though I’m generally disciplined? Yes. Does it prevent me from taking action? No, because I know it’s what I have to do.</p><p id="cde9" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Sometimes, when I’m reviewing code or building models, I’m less productive. It’s okay. Mental strength is like a muscle you develop, and it makes you more productive in the long term.</p><p id="015c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Are you doing what you like? Are you where you’re supposed to be? Do you sometimes feel tired or not as focused? It’s okay. Just keep doing what you’re doing.
