- en: For years I have introduced myself as an analytic methodologist. This aligns
    with both my formal academic training and my chosen trade. The assertion has been
    met with confusion, curiosity, and at times disapproval. For many, a *methodologist*
    is synonymous with a *generalist,* which in the world of technology implementation
    and all eyes on AI, no one much likes to be.

    and quantitative. The word “research” etymologically speaking means ‘to go about
    seeking:’ a “creative and systematic work undertaken to increase the stock of
    knowledge.” (OECD Frascati Manual 2015)

    methods, are encyclopedias of ways to approach complex problems. A *method* is
    a way of doing something; an approach. I contend that at the nexus of sound science
    and quality solutioning in any industry is methodology. The remainder of this
    article advocates for methodology as a discipline.

- en: When designing technical or analytical solutions, we are often working backwards
    from what we want to achieve. Good science says to put the problem first and then
    select relevant methods to reach a viable solution. We are to then implement those
    methods using the corresponding technologies populated with the data that the
    method(s) require. In other words, data feeds the technologies, technologies implement
    the methods, and the combination of methods solves the problem.

    we may pursue the distillation of a contact tracing solution as outlined in the
    image below. The candidate solution of contact tracing could involve two methods:
    1) social network analysis of contact, and 2) mathematical modeling of contagion
    (e.g., SEIR model). The technical implementation of these methods will involve
    selected technologies or software products, and the relevant datasets. The work
    of designing the conceptual solution is that of methodologists and data scientists.
    The work of designing the technical architecture is that of solution architects
    and engineers.'

    to solve a problem and understanding what technical components are required to
    bring those methods to fruition. It requires both creativity and a systematic
    process to comprehend multiple approaches, test them quickly, and promote one
    towards the ultimate solution.

    academic publications. In a technical project, this should be the work of a few
    weeks. It requires a scientific mindset and an agile aptitude for creativity and
    experimentation.

- en: So what is the relationship between analytic methodology and data science, or
    “AI/ML?” We see machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) getting
    a lot of attention these days. From a methodology perspective, we are able to
    put AI (as a domain of science) and ML (as a collection of methods), in their
    places alongside other technical methods. Even the coveted generative AI is simply
    an incremental development of unsupervised learning, albeit quite an innovative
    one.

    while other methods remained in the shadows of industries (like agent-based modeling…).
    The Department of Defense found it special enough to create an entirely new organization:
    the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC), now the Chief Digital and Artificial
    Intelligence Office (CDAO). There are congressionally-appointed funding streams
    for the application of ML algorithms and generative AI.'

    require a lot of computational power. And really good data. Ultimately, ML algorithms
    are computational implementations of complex math. This means that the results
    of complex math are now in the hands of analyst users. *That*, I would argue,
    is a little special.

- en: ML algorithms can also evolve beyond their intended training or purpose, which
    is something other methods cannot do. This is the “learning” in machine learning,
    and the “generative” in generative AI. But the most arresting feature we now see
    in this class of methods is in language generation. Regardless of the actual capability
    or comprehension of a large language model (LLM), it speaks our language. And
    when something speaks to you in your native tongue, something about the experience
    engenders trust. [#anthropomorphism](/what-do-large-language-models-understand-befdb4411b77)
    No other method speaks back to the methodologist in plain English.

- en: While these things do make AI a unique domain of science that contains a unique
    suite of analytic methods, ML algorithms are still methods at the end of the day,
    and they are not suited to every problem. There is still a need for the methodology
    mindset in applying these methods where they are fit-for-purpose and applying
    other methods where they are not.

    across industries. I’ve written previously about [*graph analytics*](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/what-it-takes-to-build-a-great-graph-79dfcb715df4)and[*entity
    resolution*](/entity-resolved-knowledge-graphs-6b22c09a1442), the first of which
    is an analytic method, the second of which is more of a data engineering method.
    There are traditional methods (e.g., simulation, cluster analysis, time series
    analysis, sentiment analysis). Then, of course, there is machine learning (supervised,
    unsupervised, and reinforcement learning), and a suite of statistical forecasting
    methods. There are [cognitive thinking strategies](https://sourcesandmethods.blogspot.com/)
    (e.g., perspective taking, role playing, analysis of competing hypotheses, multi-criteria
    decision matrices) and more practitioner-focused capabilities (e.g., geospatial
    modeling, pattern-of-life analysis, advanced data visualization techniques).

    one industry to the next. Ultimately, they are Lego pieces intended for a methodologist
    to assemble into the grandeur of a solution to whatever challenge the industry
    or enterprise is facing.

    what can we learn from them?’* While that is a perfectly valid question to ask
    of the data within an organization, it isn’t necessarily the best setup for scientifically-grounded
    inquiry and solutioning.

- en: For accelerated research, rapid prototyping, and quality solutioning, your organization
    requires the methodology mindset to orient around the problem and begin with the
    first principles of a solution. Without methodology, inundated with emerging technology,
    we are all just going faster and further away from the point.
