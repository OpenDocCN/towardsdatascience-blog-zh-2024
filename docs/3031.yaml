- en: In the late 1990s, two Stanford University graduate students, Larry Page and
    Sergey Brin, were working on their PhD research when they came across an interesting
    idea.

- en: 'Larry was particularly fascinated by the way web pages linked to one another.
    He saw the internet as a vast network of citations, similar to how academic papers
    reference each other. This sparked an idea: **what if a web page’s importance
    could be measured by how many other pages linked to it?** But not just that —
    **what if the importance of those linking pages also mattered?**'

- en: Intrigued by that idea, Larry started building an algorithm that would later
    be named “PageRank” (a clever play on his last name). The algorithm treated each
    link to a webpage as a vote of confidence, but with a twist — votes from more
    important pages carried more weight.

- en: Sergey Brin, interested in Larry’s concept, joined him. Together, they worked
    from their dorm rooms, building a search engine that would use this ranking system.
    At first, they called their project “BackRub” due to its analysis of backward
    links.
