    a wave of tech layoff caught all of us tech workers by surprise. In 2023, more
    than 240K tech workers were laid off across more than 1,000 companies; the most
    recent layoff at Google and Discord indicates that it’s continuing in 2024\. Both
    my current company and my pervious company had more than one round of layoff during
    the last year, with some of my friends impacted.

    the cuts were deeper than in the past. Past layoffs had often focused on functions
    such as Sales and Recruiting that were immediately affected by slowdowns in the
    business and hiring. This time, however, the impact was across the board including
    technical functions like software engineers and data scientists.

    as a data scientist (after all, that’s one of the key aspects of your job). So
    like a good data scientist, I sat down at the beginning of the year to conduct
    a “post mortem”.
