- en: I have been involved in modeling data for over 30 years, creating a variety
    of data models (3NF, dimensional, ensemble (anchor, data-vault), graphs, etc.)
    mainly for analytical systems. However, many of these have also gradually become
    outdated or obsolete. Sometimes it feels like the work of the unfortunate Sisyphus
    who persistently rolls his boulder up the hill, only to realise at some point
    that it was in vain again.

    model a common and complete view of business matters for a company. After all,
    long-time business people who have been involved in the modeling process know
    what’s going on in the company, right? Well, the smaller the company was, the
    closer I reached the goal. But to be completely honest, in the end, each model
    remained just an approximation — a static view that tried to reflect the constantly
    changing reality.

    be successful without it. The modern data-driven enterprise is based on the core
    idea of deriving value from data. However, the fact is that data has no value
    in and of itself. We need to use…
