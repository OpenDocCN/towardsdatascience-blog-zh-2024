    innovations as such: a patent is considered an augmentation innovation if its

    a monumental breakthrough Sora was](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7FymGelvi7svYbxgGHTCUl?si=5c3ba2a543b24573)¹⁴.

    effect across all workers**, which oversimplifies the reality of heterogeneous

    75th percentile** (assuming its marginal cost of AI is lower than the cost of
    employing a 75th percentile video editor). However, **for the 90th percentile
    video editor, Sora becomes a tool for augmenting**. This editor could use Sora

    by AI, with AI’s impact on workers hinging on a critical metric: whether AI performs
    better than the worker in tasks relevant to his occupation. Whether high-skilled
    or low-skilled workers benefit more depends on the nature of firm’s production.
    However, the way AI is currently used is not a good indicator for its economic
    promise, as it is a General Purpose Technology and will create new systems, products
    and drive significant productivity gains in the long-term.'

    are desirable to be in. I encourage more economists to leverage AI model benchmarks
    to create timely and granular assessments of the automation potential of workers
    in different occupations, to determine quantitatively what the desirable occupations
    are.

    impact will be determined by the choices we make. It is imperative for AI practitioners,
    economists, and policymakers to work together to ensure that AI will positively
    impact the economy and society, through redistribution mechanisms and thoughtful
    regulation that strike a balance between fostering innovation and ensuring equity.
    Only then can AI, as Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei [said in this recent essay](https://darioamodei.com/machines-of-loving-grace)
    ³⁸, become “machines of loving grace”, transforming the world for the better.
