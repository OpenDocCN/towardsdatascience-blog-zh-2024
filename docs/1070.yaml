    features that represent explainable behaviors and that maximize predictive power.

    likely implement the model you built in collaboration with business stakeholders:
    you are building them a tool that will improve their process or their targeting.'

- en: Unless the business area you are helping is analytically advanced and has a
    good understanding of machine learning (this is rare), convincing the stakeholders
    that your model makes sense is paramount.

- en: However, deep learning and tree-based models like XGBoost or Random Forest models
    are quite the black box. Thus, giving insights to your stakeholders into what
    your model does — or rather what influences the model — is key. Tools like [SHAP
    plots](https://medium.com/@shahooda637/all-you-need-to-know-about-shap-for-explainable-ai-8ad35a05e6ec)
    are very useful for you to understand what features are predictive, and their
    directionality (lower/higher value of feature = positive or negative impact on
    prediction). But how do you decide on what sort of feature you want to focus your
    engineering efforts on?
