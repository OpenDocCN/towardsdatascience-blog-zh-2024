    “How do we effectively integrate the right AI and machine learning tools into
    our business?”, and “How do we prioritize our AI initiatives, and integrate them
    with our broader company strategy?”. Especially now, after the latest AI-boom,
    these questions are higher on the agenda and seem even more urgent than before.'
  prefs: []

    of the technological innovations, but also domain and business expertise. In addition,
    it requires a fundamental understanding of the current company strategy in order
    to prioritize and select initiatives. As such, a comprehensive strategy workshop
    with the executive leadership of a company, or a division, is one of the best
    ways to uncover the answers.

    attend, how to identify the right topics for deep dives, what needs to be done
    after the workshop, and much more. The idea is that this can be used as a template
    to conduct a workshop in any industry for a company of almost any size.

    how a specific technology could be borrowed from one industry to another. Many
    technologies start out being used in one industry and then transition into others

    by involving key players in the planning process, you increase stakeholder buy-in
    and increase the chances of the workshop’s success.

    If for example one of the prioritized activities is to start doing predictive
    maintenance on wind turbines, you need start adding sensors to the turbines —
    if they don’t already have them installed — and create the data pipelines and
