When all of the information needed to answer a question is in the knowledge base, but the RAG system isn’t finding it, it seems like a failure.

Documents that are not semantically similar at all — or not quite similar enough — are left out and are not generally made available to the LLM generating a response to the prompt at query time.</p><p id="45c1" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nm nn fq no b go np nq nr gr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe of og oh fj bk">When the documents we need to answer a question in a prompt are not all semantically similar to the prompt, one or more of them is often missed by a RAG system. This can happen when answering the question requires a mix of generalized and specialized documents or terms, and when documents are detail-dense in the sense that some very important details for this specific prompt are buried in the middle of related details that aren’t as relevant to this prompt. See <a class="af oi" href="https://bit.ly/3BKZAJv" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">this article for an example of RAG missing documents</a> because two related concepts (“Space Needle” and “Lower Queen Anne neighborhood” in this case) are not semantically similar, and <a class="af oi" href="https://bit.ly/4ffhrqi" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">see this article for an example of important details getting buried</a> in detail-dense documents because vector embeddings are “lossy”.</p><p id="e4aa" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nm nn fq no b go np nq nr gr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe of og oh fj bk">When we see retrieval “failing” to find the right documents, it can be tempting to try to make vector search better or more tailored to our use case. But this would require fiddling with embeddings, and embeddings are complicated, messy, expensive to calculate, and even more expensive to fine-tune. Besides, that wouldn’t even be the best way to solve the problem.</p><p id="990c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nm nn fq no b go np nq nr gr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe of og oh fj bk">For example, looking at the example linked above, would we really want to use an embedding algorithm that puts the text “Space Needle” and “Lower Queen Anne neighborhood” close together in semantic vector space? No, fine-tuning or finding an embedding algorithm that puts those two terms very close together in semantic space would likely have some unexpected and undesired side effects.</p><p id="afa9" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nm nn fq no b go np nq nr gr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe of og oh fj bk">It is better not to try to force a semantic model to do a job that geographical or tourism information would be much better suited for. If I were a travel or tourism company who relied on knowing which neighborhood such landmarks are in, I would rather build a database that knows these things with certainty — a task that is much easier than making semantic vector search do the same task… without complete certainty.</p><p id="e7b5" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nm nn fq no b go np nq nr gr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe of og oh fj bk">So, the main issue here is that we have concepts and information that we know are related in some way, but not in semantic vector space. Some other (non-vector) source of information is telling us that there are connections among the wide variety of concepts we are working with. The task of building a graph RAG application is to effectively capture these connections between concepts into a knowledge graph, and to use the graph connections to retrieve more relevant documents for responding to a prompt.</p><figure class="mv mw mx my mz mm ms mt paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="nc nd ed ne bh nf"><div class="ms mt mu"><img src="../Images/45919597c0582672c10389bfb507e1f0.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*flPVNMUm83oc7H9Lt7U5AA.jpeg"/></div></div><figcaption class="nh ni nj ms mt nk nl bf b bg z dx">Adventures in the Knowledge Graph: Watch Your Step.

The graph design should aim to connect the right nodes, knowledge, entities, and documents at the right time, enabling the assembly of the appropriate documents to produce the most helpful and actionable query response.</p><figure class="mv mw mx my mz mm ms mt paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="nc nd ed ne bh nf"><div class="ms mt mu"><img src="../Images/3aab095f20acb4e42a985703a33ee2c4.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*orXW5uw-geBo-WVtZUxWXQ.jpeg"/></div></div><figcaption class="nh ni nj ms mt nk nl bf b bg z dx">Adventures in the Knowledge Graph: Knowledge is Money.

A knowledge graph can connect people, projects, products, customers, meetings, locations, etc — and all of these are somewhat limited in number by the size of the organization and the work it does. Building and managing a graph of thousands of employees is much more tractable than, for example, trying to do the same with all of the people mentioned on Wikipedia or in a large database of financial or legal documents. So, possibly the first great decision that Glean made was to find a great use case for graph RAG to tackle.</p><p id="ce7d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nm nn fq no b go np nq nr gr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe of og oh fj bk">One often understated aspect of graph RAG systems is the quality and reliability of the input data and the pipelines that get it there. This has more to do with data engineering and traditional software development than AI. In previous tech paradigms, connecting different data systems was challenging due to incompatible data types and access methods. Now, AI and LLMs enable the integration of disparate sources of unstructured data, allowing for the consolidation of data from various origins into a single RAG system. This integration capability enables LLMs to process and make sense of unstructured data from various sources, such as internal web pages, wikis, code repositories, databases, Google Docs, and chat logs. Simply connecting all of this information together and making it accessible from a single interface can be a big win.</p><h1 id="6fc6" class="on oo fq bf op oq or gq os ot ou gt ov ow ox oy oz pa pb pc pd pe pf pg ph pi bk">The way forward</h1><p id="a345" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nm nn fq no b go pj nq nr gr pk nt nu nv pl nx ny nz pm ob oc od pn of og oh fj bk">Construction of graph RAG systems for any use case involves leveraging foundational components such as data stores for vectors and graphs, embeddings, and LLMs, enhanced by open-source orchestration tools like LangChain and LlamaIndex. These tools facilitate the development of robust, scalable, and efficient systems, promising a future where companies achieve substantial success by optimizing knowledge work through automation and streamlining.</p><p id="6b01" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nm nn fq no b go np nq nr gr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe of og oh fj bk">The public success of knowledge graphs and graph RAG systems, particularly by companies like Glean, showcases how effective these technologies are for internal use cases, creating value by making the organization more efficient. However, the broader application potential for external, enterprise and consumer-facing products remains largely untapped, presenting many opportunities for other companies to explore.</p><p id="7074" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nm nn fq no b go np nq nr gr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe of og oh fj bk">It is perhaps notable that we have been in what is called the “Information Age” for at least 30 years, and it is only in the past year or two that we have really started to put together the building blocks for connecting all of this information across sources, across ideas, across documents, and across concepts, so that our software systems can make the same types of reasoning, logic, and judgment that we as humans use as a daily part of our knowledge work. Some people are calling this the “Intelligence Age”.</p><p id="bbff" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nm nn fq no b go np nq nr gr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe of og oh fj bk">While initially focusing on simple, straightforward decisions, AI’s trajectory is set towards managing more complex scenarios, dramatically improving efficiency in both time and cost.
