    setting to select good control variables, or, avoid selecting the bad ones, using
    Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG). I started my own causal inference journey through
    potential outcomes model, which was introduced in my previous [article](https://medium.com/geekculture/an-introduction-of-randomized-experiment-aka-a-b-testing-and-potential-outcome-model-f2c93f73d426).
    I just “discovered” DAG recently from taking Prof. Jason Roos’ amazing experimentation
    and causal inference class, and really like DAG as a framework to easily theorize
    and visualize a causal model. It facilitates the identification analysis by making
    variables included in the model and the assumptions made about the relationships
    between these variables salient. As a result, it also helps with identifying the
    confounding variables and analyzing how to de-confound.

    Cunningham’s Causal Inference [Mixtape](https://mixtape.scunning.com/03-directed_acyclical_graphs)
    is a helpful start), and I believe that the quickest way to get a grasp of the
    backdoor criterion is by means of examples. Therefore, I will proceed as follows:
    first, I will lay out the question we want to answer and provide the DAG representation
    for us to easily conceptualize it; Next, I will explain what backdoor…'
