- en: What if human intelligence derives from successful next token prediction, and
    what if next token prediction is a sufficient objective function for emergence
    of artificial general intelligence?

- en: This post frames and explores the hypothesis that general intelligence arises
    when a learning system becomes very good at next token prediction. This hypothesis
    is often implied, hidden, or dancing at the margins of industrial and academic
    AI research — but so far, I don’t think it’s received as much open discussion
    as I think it merits. Here I explore the idea from different angles, including
    via discussions of existing LLM pretraining objectives, humans as prediction machines,
    beneficial properties of next token prediction, and missing pieces. My motivation
    in writing this post is to spark deeper interest in the relationship between next
    token prediction and the development of intelligent thought.

- en: I was driving to the park last week and suddenly felt that it would be so depressing
    if the language center in my brain is merely a next word predictor. Large language
    models acquire [incredible emergent abilities](https://glassboxmedicine.com/2023/11/26/sparks-of-artificial-general-intelligence-highlights-from-95-pages/)
    from predicting the next word, so could my own linguistic intelligence also come
    from something as simplistic as predicting the next word?
