- en: When starting in data science, I was hyper-focused on learning Python, Machine
    Learning, Statistics, etc. While these are necessary, there is another skill that
    most tend to overlook at their peril—*communication*. In this article, I discuss
    why data scientists must be effective communicators and share 7 tips that have
    helped me improve this skill set.
