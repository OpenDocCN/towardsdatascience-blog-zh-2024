    what extent it returns sustainable and reliable results. Good craftsmanship, governance,
    ethics, and education on AI are what we need now.

- en: Since I was a kid, I have always been intrigued and interested in new technology
    and today we live in a world where smart and connected devices have become a part
    of our daily lives. When you have a background in engineering or another technical
    background this might be the greatest time to be around. However, there is a catch
    to the new and smart technology and it becomes slowly but surely more visible;
    a device where all physical parts are working perfectly fine can become a brick
    due to a missing internet connection or a wrong software update. One key part
    is that the logic is not necessarily hard coded anymore on the device itself but
    is a model that is externally stored and loaded. The new logic is becoming data-driven
    and critical in the transition towards smarter devices as it should better interact
    with our personal preferences. In this blog I will discuss that *not all solutions
    require data and data does not need to be incorporated into all solutions but
    there are solutions where we do need data.*
