    since I was 14 years old (tell me you are from Gen X without telling me you are
    from Gen X) and in all of these decades I have always worked for someone else.
    I very much remember the dot com bust in the early 2000’s when there were plenty
    of tech layoffs, but it felt mild relative to what is going on today. Perceiving
    that company loyalty is a thing of the past along with the desire to be my own
    boss, I decided that it was time to start my own company to do data science and
    freelancing. What I have discovered in the past 3 months of doing so is that going
    solo is very viable, even during times of layoffs, with proper planning. So I
    wanted to write about my experience getting started in the hopes that it can help
    some others out there who might be having a hard time finding the next thing.
    This is written from a US perspective, so there are some mechanics that will likely
    be different in other countries, but the general ideas remain the same.

    a company means job security. So many (most?) of us, when we move between jobs,
    are moving between companies rather than opportunities. There can be great stability
    in working for a company. You are guaranteed certain benefits like a paycheck
    of a known amount provided at regular intervals. You get other things too like
    health insurance, career guidance and management, training opportunities, retirement
    savings, etc. In going out on your own, none of those things are guaranteed. So
    it is no wonder that many (most?) people think of companies as being the most
    stable and reliable places to work.

    retirement was based on a [pension](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100314/whats-difference-between-401k-and-pension-plan.asp)
    and your pension was based on how many years you worked for a company and your
    salary during that time. The idea was that you were guaranteed income from the
    company after your retirement. In some cases your pension could even be passed
    down to your children. It was a great deal! But like the dot com collapse in the
    early 2000’s, [many pension programs were dissolved](https://www.investopedia.com/4-major-pension-problems-and-the-laws-that-protect-you-4692864)
    due to bankruptcy, mismanagement of funds, or other catastrophic investment losses,
    leading to the loss of retirement by hard working employees. The rise of the 401k
    retirement system was upon us. That system resulted in a retirement income that
    was portable, meaning you didn’t have to work your entire career for the same
    employer to have decent retirement savings. Hence, workers no longer have to rely
    on a company benefit (pension) to be able to retire.

    (salary, 401k contributions, health insurance, etc.). It is natural to be fearful
    of this. However, in this time of layoffs that rival the early 2000’s, I ask whether
    that feeling of security working for a company is just a myth?

    as well as through conversations within my network I know that open roles for
    data scientists are presently resulting in thousands of applicants. If you are
    applying for these roles, the odds of getting a call back are very, *very* slim.
    You are literally one of thousands of people they are considering. However, if
    you go out solo, you will be talking directly to the person making the decisions
    on contracting. Further, unlike many companies that post open roles and then never
    hire people into them, if they are talking to you at all it likely is because
    they have real work that needs to be done. If they are even talking to someone
    else, it is likely that there are only a small handful of potential applicants.
    Your odds of getting noticed are much better once you can make contact. For more
    on how to do this, see my section on networking below.

    So if you decide that you are only going to work 4 days per week (or even less!),
    great. If you don’t want to be sitting at your desk from 9–5, don’t! You have
    infinite freedom here to define what your work life is like and you can optimize
    it however you want! In my case, I love to ski and live 5 miles from a world-class
    ski resort. So I make the rules where I can decide to go out and ski whenever
    I like — and my boss fully supports that!

    been what has been most striking! While I knew in theory that they existed, when
    you actually start living and working this way you can come to a much better realization
    of work-life balance. For the first time in my working career I feel like I actually
    have control over my work and my happiness. I am not subjected to the whims of
    an employer who may or may not have loyalty to me. And let’s face it, corporate
    loyalty is a thing of the past.

- en: There is a lot that should go into this before you strike out on your own. Much
    of it is financial. You need to know that you will likely be without a paycheck
    for a bit and it might take you a few months or more to build back to your full,
    corporate paycheck. So if you have the opportunity to save some money to get you
    through that time, it will really help.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, you should sit down and do the math looking at how much money you need
    to bring in per month since this will be important in determining your rates.
    In my case, my goal was to replace my corporate salary. I am the primary breadwinner
    (and sometimes sole breadwinner since my spouse works a seasonal job) for my family.
    So I looked at not only my salary, but also the cost of health insurance, how
    much money I was putting into my retirement savings, and my expected expenses
    for running the business (to include paying for lawyers and accountants). This
    determined what my gross income needed to be. Next, you have to know that when
    you are self employed in the US you will be paying quarterly estimates on your
    income taxes. This amounts to approximately 35%. Using this I was able to determine
    what my net income per month needs to be in order to break even on my corporate
    salary.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, you need to consider what your pricing model will be. Will you be charging
    hourly and then tracking your hours? Will you be on retainer for a fixed fee per
    month? Maybe you will charge on a per project basis? As you looking to be the
    person doing the coding (freelance) or advising on how to get a project going
    (consulting)? Maybe instead you are seeking a fractional role? Getting started,
    I found it easiest to wrap my head around the hourly freelance concept. People
    who have been working solo for a while will tell you that this is not ideal and
    that it is much more desirable to be on retainer. At this stage, my clients prefer
    hourly billing, so that is what I am doing. So it is easy to see that you can
    take that break-even monthly net income and work backwards to what hourly rate
    you should be charging to get there.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But ***here is a gotcha***! I originally thought I would take that amount and
    assume 40 hours per week to work out the hourly rate. Wrong! You need to build
    in some slack because, as it turns out, most of us don’t actually work 40 hours
    per week, even in corporate. For example, I do not charge clients when I have
    lunch, walk the dog, work out, or pick my kid up from school. I also only bill
    when I am at my keyboard working on things for my clients and not when I happen
    to be [“sitting around” just thinking about their problems](https://www.findlaw.com/legalblogs/greedy-associates/a-wee-time-management-question-do-you-bill-for-bathroom-breaks/#:~:text=Double%20billing%20and%20padded%20billing,bathroom%20billing%20should%20be%20fine.).
    You also need to allocate time for networking, setting up the next contracts,
    etc. A mentor told me that a good rule-of-thumb was to assume that **you will
    actually only be billing 60% of the time**. This gives you a practical buffer
    such that you are still hitting your goal net income on a realistic number of
    billable hours.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So based on this, I set my hourly rate. When I compared that rate to contractors
    of similar experience levels I had worked with in previous roles, it seemed realistic.
    (Consider that contracting shops will typically tack on around a third for their
    fees, so the rate a contractor actually takes home is typically around two thirds
    of what the contract shop bills for.) I utilized my network and bounced this rate
    off of them and they all agreed that my hourly rate was appropriate.

    also plan out the setup for the business. There are many different ways you can
    do this and **I am not a lawyer so you should consult with one** before making
    your decision. One way you can do this is just to be working as an individual,
    independent contractor (sometimes referred to as a 1099 based on the tax documentation
    used in this approach). Another option is to set up an actual business such as
    an LLC or Corporation. I elected to create an LLC because it provides a certain
    amount of legal protection and separation between the business’s finances and
    my personal finances (i.e. it is hard for clients to go after your personal finances
    if they sue the business). I enlisted the aid of a lawyer to help me set one up
    in my home state. There are also plenty of online options for doing this where
    you might be able to do it yourself, but I felt the peace of mind of having a
    trained professional do this for me was worth it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I also worked with my accountant who does my family’s personal taxes to help
    with the business taxes. I cannot say too much about this since I have not submitted
    my first quarterly estimated payment yet, so that will likely be included in a
    future post. However, one thing that I can say at this stage is that it is VERY
    important that you save receipts for EVERYTHING. There are many expenses you will
    have such as fees paid to the lawyer, computers, web pages and domain names, etc.
    that are tax deductible. However, they have to be tracked and accounted for. You
    will save yourself a lot of time later if you start by religiously tracking these
    things.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, once you have the business set up, it can help setting up a separate
    bank account for it. While maybe not required, I find this helpful since it really
    keeps the business finances cleanly separated from my personal finances. When
    it is time to get paid, the business cuts you a check. Having a debit card linked
    to that account further helps keep things separate.

    That is especially true when freelancing or consulting. When I decided that I
    would start my own business and particularly once the LLC was formed, the first
    thing I did was to reach out to my network to let them know what I was doing.
    I have been very fortunate in my career, about 23 years to this point, to have
    met many great people working directly in data science or in companies who regularly
    work with data scientists. I initially started by quietly talking with a few of
    my mentors, but then when I was ready I announced on LinkedIn that I had launched
    the company. I was very fortunate that there were some people in my network who
    had need for someone to do freelancing LLM work on an hourly basis. Some of the
    interest came from people I had worked with in the past. Other interest came from
    people who had seen content of mine online.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'In my opinion, networking is the area where people who have been laid off (or
    other considering this as an option for layoff protection) might have a more difficult
    time than financial planning. However, that doesn’t mean that you can’t build
    your network quickly. Attending (better yet: speaking at) conferences and meetups
    is a great way to do this. Ideally, you have an employer that is willing to pay
    for you to go. Even if they aren’t, consider this an investment in yourself and
    your career. If you are running a solo business already, you can write these trips
    off. Many of the bigger conferences offer discounts to people who are unemployed.
    Additionally, most (many? all?) conferences need volunteers to help at them. So
    even if you are not speaking, you can still have the opportunity to meet and network
    with people. Writing blog posts and participating in open source projects are
    also ways to grow your network. Additionally, it can be helpful to have a portfolio
    of work for others to view.'

    me in the first few months be more efficient. Pretty much all of them have to
    do with the philosophy of **making it easy for your clients.**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You should consider that there are some tools (which are business expenses)
    that will be expected. First, just like working in corporate you should have an
    email address specific to your work. For me, I bought a domain name for my business
    and set up a Google workspace for that domain. This will also help when certain
    platforms ask for your work email address and scoff at a Gmail address. I then
    take advantage of Google Sheets for managing my expenses and time tracking. (I
    might move this to QuickBooks, but haven’t made that transition yet. Ask me after
    this first round of taxes if it is worth it.)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, I found it very helpful to have a means to allow people to easily book
    time with me. I found [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) to be a great option for
    this. If you are going to do this, I would suggest that you place some limits
    on the hours that people can book with you. Remember that when you are not billing,
    you are not earning. So try to avoid spending all of your time in prospecting
    meetings.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I also have put some thought into how to send invoices and receive payment.
    Again, the idea here is to make it easy for your client to pay you. You can set
    up accounts with Stripe or Square to do this or QuickBooks can do it for you.
    However, bear in mind that they will charge fees of something like 3% on the total
    invoice. This can really add up. Another option for receiving payment is directly
    via bank transfer/ACH, which can be harder for your clients but does not take
    off those fees. Be prepared to work with your clients on what works best for them.
    And bear in mind that having a business banking account, whether for ACH transfer
    or Stripe/Square/QuickBooks, means that you are not handing out your personal
    banking information to clients.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, it is important to know that every client will have a different set
    of tools that they are most comfortable with. Some prefer Slack. Others are very
    Microsoft-centric, preferring Teams. While I personally have very strong personal
    preferences, I have found it important to be able to work within any of them.
    In my case, this means that I had to buy a PC since my Linux machine doesn’t handle
    Teams very well. *C’est la vie.*

    consider freelancing because of the lack of security, I actually find myself feeling
    ***much*** more secure than in the corporate world. For one, I am not subjected
    to layoffs. In fact, my guess is that more companies will start turning to freelancers,
    contract employees, and fractional employees *because* of their layoffs. It is
    not like they have decreased the amount of work that has to be done just because
    they have laid people off. They will need people to come in and do that work,
    even if they are not adding to their head count. Contracts will come and go and
    constantly securing contracts is part of this lifestyle.
