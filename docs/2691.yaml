- en: One of the reasons Machine Learning is such an interesting field is it allows
    us to apply computing logic to areas that previously were untouchable. While computers
    are extremely effective with arrays and integers, they have traditionally been
    less apt at dealing with emergent properties. For example, you cannot look at
    just one pixel on a screen and know the image is a dog. You have to synthesize
    lots of data points.

    Computer Vision models— specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Today,
    I’m going to show how to apply them to image classification.

- en: Classification of real world data is very useful for integrating machine learning
    technology into more typical software systems. If you’re in e-commerce, you may
    use this information to automatically categorize a new product. If you’re in medicine,
    you may use this to determine if an X-Ray or MRI looks similar to previous images
    that required surgery. Finally, if you’re in a vehicle and looking to drive safely,
    image classification is a key part of object detection and collision avoidance.
