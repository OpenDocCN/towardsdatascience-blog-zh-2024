    model [1], a powerful model that allows you to create your own videos, as you
    have seen with [OpenAI Sora](https://openai.com/sora). I will discuss different
    tasks to which you can apply the model to, like generating animated videos and
    creating synthetic datasets. I will then give my thoughts on the model's performance
    and discuss its strengths and weaknesses. Ultimately, you should have a clearer
    picture of the utility you can get from this model.

    seems to understand the prompt since it showcases handwriting on paper, but the
    quality of the image is low. Image by the author made with the Open-Sora-Plan
    model.

    scientist is to keep up with the latest models within machine learning. Keeping
    up with the constant advances in AI takes time and effort. Therefore, I bring
    up some promising models I discovered on pages like [PapersWithCode](https://paperswithcode.com/),
    [GitHub](https://github.com/), and [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/blog)
    in a series of articles. After finding a model interesting, I test it myself to
    see if it can be helpful for anything I am working with, which could be for work
    or personal projects. If the model could be beneficial, I then consider applying
    the model to the tasks I need it for.
