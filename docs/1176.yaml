    and refreshing. A good apple can improve my mood and put a smile on my face. However,
    if I fail to notice the apple is rotting, that nasty apple is going to wipe the
    smile off my face and leave a bad taste in my mouth.'

    Data can be delicious and leave you wanting more, but it can also go sour and
    leave your business feeling nauseous.

    can be used to guide and inform decisions, and it often has the potential to uncover
    valuable opportunities. But beware: it is possible to get negative returns from
    data.'

    day and age when everyone knows there are nuggets of value locked away in the
    data. There isn’t a data team in the world eager to admit they are causing more
    problems than they are solving. Their mandate is to empower the business with
    data, not to slow things down.
