After finishing my bachelor’s degree in mathematics that was very theory heavy, for master studies I chose some courses that involved mathematical modeling and optimization of economic issues. My favorite topic at that time was time-series. It was relatively relaxed to get an overview of different modeling approaches. Proven methods had been in place for over a decade and had not changed rapidly.</p><p id="8a1c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ng nh fq nj b go nk nl nm gr nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc fj bk">Similar conditions existed until a few years ago when entering the world of data science. The fundamental techniques and models were relatively quick to learn. In implementation, a lot was solved <em class="ni">from scratch</em>, own networks were coded and worked. New tools &amp; technologies were welcomed and tried out.</p><p id="aa8e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ng nh fq nj b go nk nl nm gr nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc fj bk">Today, the feeling is different. Now, when one takes a look at the X or LinkedIn feeds, one almost weekly receives news about important tools and developments.</p><p id="a78d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ng nh fq nj b go nk nl nm gr nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc fj bk">Since the hype about LLMs with the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, it has become extreme. The race is on between open source and closed source. Google followed with Gemini, Meta released LLama, and Stanford University introduced Alpaca. Applications are operationalized using tools like Langchain, and a whole range of tools for standardizing applications are emerging. Tuning mechanisms are continually improved. And then there was also the release of xgboost 2.</p><p id="300b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ng nh fq nj b go nk nl nm gr nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc fj bk">The wheel seems to be turning at an ever-faster speed. In recent years, this is largely due to methodological breakthroughs in GenAI and the ever-growing toolbox in the MLOps area.</p><p id="6cf2" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ng nh fq nj b go nk nl nm gr nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc fj bk">And it’s important to follow: What’s happening in the market?

How can we use it profitably?</p><p id="60ff" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ng nh fq nj b go nk nl nm gr nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc fj bk">Today, it is essential to keep the ball rolling!

I like meeting new people, learning about different approaches, and exchanging ideas and problems that might be completely new to me. Yet, I found no sleep those nights. The <em class="ni">I’ll need to check this later in more depth</em>-list seems impossible to tackle. FOMO (fear of missing out) kicks in. Thoughts occur like “<em class="ni">isn’t it already too late to jump on the train for GenAI?</em>” At that moment, I overlooked the fact that I was part of the bias, too. My presentation was about a use case we implemented with a client. Two years of work compressed into thirty minutes. Did the audience take away valuable impulses and food for thought as intended? Or did the contribution also subtly cause FOMO?</p><p id="e5be" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ng nh fq nj b go nk nl nm gr nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc fj bk">Another phenomenon that keeps reappearing is the imposter syndrome [1]. It describes the emerge of strong doubts about one’s own abilities, coupled with the fear of being exposed as a “fraud.” People who suffer from imposter syndrome often feel as though they are not capable or qualified for the positions or tasks they hold. This can also arise through comparisons with others, leading to a momentary self-perception: “<em class="ni">I can’t actually do anything good.</em>”</p><p id="d57e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ng nh fq nj b go nk nl nm gr nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc fj bk">From honest exchanges with people from my work environment, I know that this crops up from time to time for many.

It’s about a functioning system that creates added value. If you’re not a researcher but a data scientist in business, the focus is on application. A model or heuristic learns a logic that a human being cannot learn in such detail and/or apply on such a scale. It doesn’t have to be an end-to-end, fully automated solution.</p><p id="e04d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ng nh fq nj b go nk nl nm gr nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc fj bk">One should start with the development of a system that <strong class="nj fr">works</strong> and is <strong class="nj fr">accepted</strong> by the stakeholders.

There are many options for a quick overview: tl;dr summaries, overview repositories, YouTube channels etc. However, I also quickly forget the topics if I don’t spend more time on them. Therefore, to familiarize myself with a specific topic or technology, I have no choice but to occasionally block out an evening or a Saturday to delve into it.</p><p id="b7b8" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ng nh fq nj b go nk nl nm gr nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc fj bk">The fact that personal knowledge acquisition takes time also directly reveals the limitation that everyone has.</p><p id="b28c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ng nh fq nj b go nk nl nm gr nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc fj bk">Another aspect is that one<strong class="nj fr"> cannot force experience</strong>. The ability to adopt new technologies also increases with the amount of experience one has already gained. The same applies to the ability to assess technologies and tools. The greater one’s own wealth of experience, the easier it becomes. But this requires having first developed a deeper understanding of other technologies, which can only be achieved through hands-on experience.</p><h1 id="e44d" class="ol om fq bf on oo op gq oq or os gt ot ou ov ow ox oy oz pa pb pc pd pe pf pg bk">Connect &amp; collect information.</h1><p id="f9a5" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ng nh fq nj b go ph nl nm gr pi no np nq pj ns nt nu pk nw nx ny pl oa ob oc fj bk">Don’t be afraid to ask questions. Trying things out on a higher level isn’t wrong. But sometimes it’s also worth actively seeking out experiences. Maybe there’s already someone in your company or network who has already worked with technology xy? Why don’t go for a joint topic lunch? The basic prerequisite for this: being in an environment where you can ask questions (!).</p><p id="48aa" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ng nh fq nj b go nk nl nm gr nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc fj bk">Additionally, stay engaged. As described above: The best way to retain things is by doing them. However, this doesn’t mean that it isn’t worth keeping a systematic eye out left and right and staying informed about news that doesn’t fall within the (current) scope of work. There are many great newsletters out there.

We always start at a high level to ensure that all members are on board and do not assume that everyone is already deep into the subject.

We explored and experimented with various fine-tuning methods together. More importantly, we had a series of valuable insights into business issues, determining which mechanisms might be more effective. We left the meeting with many good ideas and further research tasks. This is far more valuable than in-depth knowledge of every detail.</p></div></div></div><div class="ab cb od oe of og" role="separator"><span class="oh by bm oi oj ok"/><span class="oh by bm oi oj ok"/><span class="oh by bm oi oj"/></div><div class="fj fk fl fm fn"><div class="ab cb"><div class="ci bh ev ew ex ey"><p id="31fd" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ng nh fq nj b go nk nl nm gr nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc fj bk">Recently, I had a refreshing experience at a data science meetup.</p><p id="f813" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ng nh fq nj b go nk nl nm gr nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc fj bk">The speakers worked in the logistics sector and developed an LLM-system.

Then, they shared their current prompts and the history of previous attempts with different prompts and models. This included a comparison with goodness-of-fit-metrics (!).

Quantum leaps in AI are happening and wait to be used for good. The barriers to accessing these are falling: proprietary models are challenged by open source projects. Papers and code are largely accessible. Online, there many good tutors, willing to share their experiences and teach things, thus further reducing barriers. This allows many people not only to participate in AI progress but also to shape it.
