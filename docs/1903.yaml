  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To generate “images that sound”, the researchers used a clever technique by
    combining two diffusion models into one. One of the diffusion models is a text-to-image
    model **(**[Stable Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752)**)**, and the
    other is a text-to-spectrogram model **(**[Auffusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01044)**)**.
    Each of these models receives its own prompt, which is encoded into an embedding
    and determines its own denoising instruction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, multiple different denoising instructions are problematic, because
    the model needs to decide how to denoise the image. In the paper, the authors
    solve this problem by averaging the denoising instructions from both prompts,
    effectively guiding the model to optimize for both prompts equally.

    both the image and audio prompt equally well. One downside of this is that the
    output will always be a mix of the two and not every sound or image coming out
    of the model will look/sound great. This inherent tradeoff significantly limits
    the model’s output quality.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: AI is commonly defined as computer systems mimicking human intelligence (e.g.
    [IMB](https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence), [TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/AI-Artificial-Intelligence),
    [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-artificial-intelligence)).
    This definition works well for sales forecasting, image classification, and text
    generation AI models. However, it comes with the inherent restriction that a computer
    system can only be an AI if it performs a task that humans have historically solved.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the real world, there exist a high (likely infinite) number of problems solvable
    through intelligence. While human intelligence has cracked some of these problems,
    most remain unsolved. Among these unsolved problems, some are known (e.g. curing
    cancer, quantum computing, the nature of consciousness) and others are unknown.
    If your goal is to tackle these unsolved problems, mimicking human intelligence
    does not appear to be an optimal strategy.

    cancer without mimicking human intelligence would not be considered AI. This is
    clearly counterintuitive and counterproductive. I do not intend to start a debate
    on “the one and only definition”. Instead, I want to emphasize that AI is much
    more than an automation tool for human intelligence. It has the potential to solve
    problems that we did not even know existed.

    that they sound like noise. For an alien face, this might be a suitable musical
    underscore. However, listening to the cat example, there seems to be no intentional
    relationship between the sounds and the spectrogram image. Human composers were
    able to generate waveforms that look like a certain thing when transformed to
    a spectrogram. However, to my knowledge, no human has been able to produce examples
    where the sound and images match, according to predefined criteria.

    a cat. It can also produce audio that sounds like a spaceship and looks like a
    dolphin. It is capable of producing intentional associations between the sound
    and image representation of the audio signal. In this regard, the AI exhibits
    non-human intelligence.

    enhance economic outputs through automation. While most would agree that this
    is highly desirable to some extent, others feel threatened by this perspective

    up replacing the work we love doing. Hence, our lives could become more productive,
    but less meaningful.

- en: Images that Sound is one of my favorite papers of 2024\. It uses advanced AI
    training techniques to achieve a purely artistic outcome that creates a new audiovisual
    art form. What is most fascinating is that this art form exists outside of human
    capabilities, as of this day. We can learn from this paper that AI is not barely
    a set of automation tools that mimick human behavior. Instead, AI can enrich the
    aesthetic experiences of our lives by enhancing existing art or creating entirely
    novel works and art forms. We are only starting to see the beginnings of the AI
    revolution and I cannot wait to shape and experience its (artistic) consequences.
