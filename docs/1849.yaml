- en: '*Reinforcement Learning* (RL) is a fascinating subfield of Machine Learning.
    You might already know it from applications such as playing Go [1], autonomous
    driving [2], and more.'

- en: Equally fascinating in my opinion is Sutton’s and Barto’s famous book, “Reinforcement
    Learning” [3]. I think it’s a great introduction to the topic, but also dives
    deep and introduces all important theoretical topics of the field. It can be a
    lot to read though, and especially upon the first read might look a bit mathy.

    I believe getting the contents explained with different words will greatly help
    understanding. And I will also implement all (most) algorithms from the book in
    Python and apply them to problems and environments modeled via (formerly) OpenAI’s
    gymnasium framework [4]. These two points are, as far as I know, novel so far
    and make this series unique.

    then give a quick overview of how Sutton’s book is structured — and how…
