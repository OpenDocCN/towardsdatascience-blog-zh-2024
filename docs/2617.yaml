    it. The *Lex Taleonis*envisioned a legal world where everything could be described
    by linear equations: every crime would create an output proportional to its input.
    And since the punishment for an offense was proportional to the crime, it avoided
    excessive retribution and explosions of violence that left everything in their
    wake destroyed.'
