    the potential risks tied to image generation and inpainting capabilities, it is
    necessary to establish a robust safety mitigation stack across different stages
    of the model’s lifecycle.” [Trupti Bavalatti](https://medium.com/u/5e12b2dd1577?source=post_page---user_mention--927c5a9063b9--------------------------------)

    presents the work he and his team have focused on in recent months: a network
    of nodes that share computational power to execute inference on open source models,
    “where computation is distributed dynamically and efficiently, while also maintaining
    a high level of security and rewarding users for sharing their computation.”'

    analysis has numerous use cases in day-to-day data science workflows—and it can
    also help us detect patterns and relationships in works of art. Case in point:
    [Maria Mouschoutzi, PhD](https://medium.com/u/dce3cb684eae?source=post_page---user_mention--927c5a9063b9--------------------------------)’s
    fascinating project, which relies on the NetworkX library and Marimo notebooks
    to study the intricate social landscape represented in Victor Hugo’s *Les Misérables*.
    Whether you’re team Valjean or team Javert—or just into learning about new data
    science tools—you should add it to your reading list.'

    as Vaswani et al.’s 2017 landmark contribution. Why share another one, you might

    terrific deep dive and we suspect you’ll see the point: it does an excellent job
