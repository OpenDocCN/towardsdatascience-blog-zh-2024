    Congress. In almost any country in the world, the figure of the hypocritical politician
    is infamous among the population. Backroom dealings and beige envelopes are ever-present
    in political drama series. At the same time, they are one of the most crucial
    groups to comprehend, as their actions directly impact the country’s future.

    by their actions, not words. Therefore, I will compare and group members of Congress
    based on their voting history. In this way, we can uncover obscure patterns and
    understand the true dynamic of a National Congress.

    from 2023 to 2024 up to May 18th. All the data is available at the Brazilian C[ongress’s
    open data portal](https://dadosabertos.camara.leg.br/). I then created two different
    pandas dataframes, one with all the laws voted on and another with how each congress
    member voted in each vote.

    name and the voting session ID to identify who and what the vote refers to. Therefore,
    I created a pivot table so that each row represents a congress member and each
    column refers to a vote, encoding Yes as 1 and No as 0 and dropping any vote where
    more than 280 deputies didn’t vote.

    of the two congressmen’s voting behavior. Also, to address the fact that some
    congress members have dozens of peers with high degrees of similarity, I only
    selected the first 25 congressmen with the highest similarity to be given an edge.

    Congress. But it is a mess, and it is impossible to really discern what’s going
    on.

- en: First of all, let me explain the colors. Red represents the base of the current
    left-wing government, so the congressmen of the party of the president or public
    allies, PT, PSOL, PCdoB, and others. Blue is the opposition led by PL, the party
    of the ex-president, and another right-wing party, NOVO.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Green and Yellow represent a phenomenon in Brazil’s politics called “Centrao”
    or “big center.” Centrao is compromised by non-aligned political parties that
    are always allied with the current government and trade their support for appointments
    to positions in government or public companies. The Yellow represents the group
    centered around UNIAO, Brazil’s biggest political party. Green is centered around
    MDB, a historical party that used to be in charge of most of the “Centrao.”

    closest allies. The yellow dots inside are mostly from AVNATE, which, despite
    publicly being in the same alliance as UNIAO, seems to be more politically aligned
    with the left.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another interesting dynamic the network model captures is the grouping of specific
    parties and ideologies inside each more extensive community. In group 1, right
    below the base of the number 1, seven nodes are very close to each other. They
    represent the congress members from PSOL, a radical left party. It’s interesting
    to see that even inside the left-wing block, they are represented in a sort of
    sub-group in the network.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Group 2 seems to be mostly compromised from what we can call “Centrao,” as explained
    before. As always, they are part of the government’s base; they are closer to
    group 1 than 3, and we can see a mix of Green and yellow, as expected, and some
    Blue dots. That means many members of Congress who should be in the opposition
    vote similarly to the government. Why? Well, PL, the current “opposition” party,
    used to be an average “Centrao” party. Hence, historical members still behave
    like the average “Centrao”.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Notably, we have the biggest nodes in group 2\. One is yellow and represents
    Waldemar Oliveira, the leader of the government in the house. He is relevant in
    Congress, as a big part of it votes according to his directives. The other two
    biggest nodes are also in group 2, but in what I call group 2.5.

- en: The reason behind Group 2.5’s behavior is beyond the article; to summarize,
    it is a group of congressmen who were elected identifying as “right-wing” but
    still behave more like “Centrao.” Only occasionally do they vote with the right,
    hence their proximity to Group 3, but whenever votes that interest Group 2 come
    up, they break away to vote with Group 2.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, group 3 has a different distribution than the other two. It is the
    smallest one in Congress and is compromised overwhelmingly by PL deputies. It
    is more “spread out” as there are a lot of members between them and group 2, showing
    that they do not always vote together. At the same time, there are no oversized
    nodes, so no clear leader exerts influence on the whole block. This pattern makes
    sense and aligns with reality since the opposition hasn’t been able to achieve
    much success in the current Congress.

    insights into political alignments and voting behaviors. Our visualization of
    voting patterns has revealed three distinct groups: the government’s base, the
    “Centrao,” and the opposition. The graph effectively illustrates the nuanced relationships
    between parties, exposing deviations from public stances and highlighting influential
    figures.'
