    to AI” means to them. In this post, I share some insights into what it means to
    be an AI-enabled business, and what you can do to get there. Not by enumerating
    things you have to do, but through two anecdotes. The first is about digitalisation
    — what it means for a non-digital company to transform into a digital company.
    This is because the transition to AI follows the same kind of path; it is a “same
    same but different” transformation. The second story is about why so many product
    companies failed in their investments in AI and Data Science over the last years,
    because they put AI in a corner.

    destination, you are better off knowing where you are going. So: what what does
    it mean to be “AI-enabled”?'

    an organisation takes upon itself in order to acquire new capabilities. And, for
    this very reason, there is a lot to learn from other transformations, if you wish
    to transition to AI.

    referred to as *digitalisation*. This is the process where a company transforms
    from using IT as a tool in their everyday work, to using IT as a strategic asset
    to achieve competitive advantage. A few years back, I spent some time in the Oil
    & Gas sector, participating in large digitalisation efforts. And if you have not
    worked in O&G, you may be surprised to learn that this huge economy still is not
    digital, to a large extent. Of course, the sector has used computers since they
    came about, but as tools: CAD-tools for design, logistics systems for project
    and production planning, CRM systems for managing employees and customers, and
    so on. But the competitive power of one company over another has been in their
    employees’ knowledge about steel and pipes and machinery, about how fluids flows
    through pipes, about installation of heavy equipment under rough conditions, and
    many other things of this trade. Computers have been perceived as tools to get
    the job done, and IT has been considered an expense to be minimised. Digitalisation
    is the transformation that aims to change that mindset.'

    about IT as an expense, to thinking of IT as an investment opportunity. By investing
    in your own IT, you can create tools and products that competitors do not have,
    and that give you a competitive advantage.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'But investing in in-house software development is expensive, so to pin down
    the right investments to shift competition in your favour, you need all the engineers,
    the steel and machinery specialists, to start thinking about which problems and
    challenges you can solve with computers in a manner that serves this cause. This
    is because, the knowledge about how to improve your products and services, is
    located in the heads of the employees: the sales people talking to the customers,
    the marketing people feeling the market trends on their fingertips, the product
    people designing and manufacturing the assets, and the engineers designing, making
    and testing the final product artefacts. These humans must internalise the idea
    of using computer technology to improve the business as a whole, and do it. That
    is the goal of digitalisation.'

    have to replace “digital transformation” by “transformation to AI”. Hence, there
    is much to learn from digitalisation programs. And if you are lucky, you already
    understand what it means to be a digital company, so you actually know what a
    transformation to digital entails.

    While there is some learning to be had from this history, I’ll say right away:
    there is still no silver bullet for going AI with a bang. But, as an industry,
    we are getting better at it. I think of this history as playing out over three
    distinct eras, demarcated by how many companies approached AI when they launched
    their first AI initiatives.'

    in large data infrastructures and hired a bunch of data scientists, placed them
    in a room, and waited for magic to emanate. But nothing happened, and the infrastructure
    and the people were really expensive, so the method was soon abandoned. The angle
    of attack was inspired by large successes such as Twitter, Facebook, Netflix,
    and Google, but the scale of these operations don’t apply to most companies. Lesson
    learned.'

- en: '**In the second era**, having learned from the first era, the AI advisors said
    that you should start by identifying the killer AI-app in your domain, hire a
    small team of Data Scientists, make an MVP, and iterate from there. This would
    give you a high-value project and star example with which you could demonstrate
    the magnificence of AI to the entire company. Everybody would be flabbergasted,
    see the light, and the AI transformation would be complete. So companies hired
    a *small* team of data scientists, placed them in a corner, and waited for magic
    to emanate. But nothing happened.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the reason why magic does not happen in this setting is that the data scientists
    and AI/ML experts hired to help in the transformation don’t know the business.
    They know neither your nor your customer’s pain points. They don’t know the hopes,
    dreams, and ambitions of the business segment. And, moreover, the people who know
    this, the product people, managers, and engineers in your organisation, they don’t
    know the data scientists, or AI, or what AI can be used for. And they don’t understand
    what the Data Scientists are saying. And before these groups learn to talk *with*
    each other, there will be no magic. Because, before that, no AI transformation
    has taken place.

    talent, don’t try to turn your other-area experts into Data Scientists over night.

    onset. Don’t hesitate to go externally to find someone to help you get started.

    AI example that the rest of the organisation can recognise, understand, and critique.
    If the domain experts and the product people come forth saying “But you solved
    the wrong problem! What you should have done is…” you can consider it a victory.
    By then, you have the key resources talking to each other, collaborating to find
    new and better solutions to the problems you already have set out to solve.

    is one of the main reasons groups or organisations fail in their initial AI-initiatives.
    Not having the AI-resources interacting closely with the product teams should
    be considered rigging for failure. You need the AI-initiatives to be driven by
    the product teams — that is how you ensure that the AI solutions contribute to
    solving the right problems.
