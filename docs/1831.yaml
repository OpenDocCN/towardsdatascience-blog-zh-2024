- en: Managing data models at scale is a common challenge for data teams using [dbt
    (data build tool)](https://www.getdbt.com/). Initially, teams often start with
    simple models that are easy to manage and deploy. However, as the **volume of
    data grows** and **business** **needs** **evolve**, the **complexity** of these
    models **increases**.

- en: This progression often leads to a **monolithic** **repository** where all dependencies
    are intertwined, making it **difficult** for different teams to **collaborate**
    efficiently. To address this, data teams may find it beneficial to distribute
    their data models across multiple dbt projects. This approach not only promotes
    **better organisation and modularity** but also enhances the scalability and maintainability
    of the entire data infrastructure.

- en: One significant complexity introduced by handling multiple dbt projects is the
    way they are executed and deployed. Managing library dependencies becomes a critical
    concern, especially when different projects require different versions of dbt.
    While dbt Cloud offers a robust solution for scheduling and executing multi-repo
    dbt projects, it comes with significant investments that not every organisation
    can afford or find…
