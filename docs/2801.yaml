- en: As artificial intelligence advances, training large-scale neural networks, including
    large language models, has become increasingly critical. The growing size and
    complexity of these models not only elevate the costs and energy requirements
    associated with training but also highlight the necessity for effective hardware
    utilization. In response to these challenges, researchers and engineers are exploring
    distributed decentralized training strategies. In this blog post, we will examine
    various methods of distributed training, such as data-parallel training and gossip-based
    averaging, to illustrate how these approaches can optimize model training efficiency
    while addressing the rising demands of the field.

    data across multiple devices (workers). This method not only enables several workers
    to compute gradients simultaneously, thereby improving training speed, but also
    allows…
