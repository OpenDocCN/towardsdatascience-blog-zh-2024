    just a few years ago, uncertainty is not only here to stay, but also requires
    a different treatment than customary in machine learning when used in decision
    making.

    tasks and explain how optimal decisions can be derived by modeling the system
    as a continuous-time Markov chain, aka Markov Jump Process.

    CLIP, a groundbreaking model from OpenAI that forms the basis for large multi-modal
    models such as LLava and GPTv4\. Let’s assume, it is able to label an image containing
    a chicken with 70% accuracy. While this is incredible performance, in 30% of the
    cases, the label will be wrong.
