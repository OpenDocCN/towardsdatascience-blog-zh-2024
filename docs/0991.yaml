- en: Organizations generate voluminous amounts of data on a daily basis. Dashboards
    are built to analyze this data and derive meaningful business insights as well
    as to track KPIs. Over time, we find ourselves with hundreds (or maybe more) of
    such dashboards. Oftentimes, this *Dashboard Proliferation* is driven by multiple
    groups developing their own analyses in silos without visibility into analytics
    that may already be available. For example, sales teams may create a dashboard
    to track their forecasts vs. actual sales not knowing that a *forecast accuracy*
    dashboard is already available and used by the supply chain team. Not only does
    this result in duplication of efforts but we may end up with common metrics and
    analyses across multiple dashboards with no single source of truth.
