frameworks, design patterns, and principles to scale their products and seamlessly adjust their architecture to support new use cases and handle increasing usage and complexity. This allows software engineering teams to ensure optimized performance and reliability as their platform (and its value) grows in scale.</p><p id="c2f0" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fr ng b gp nh ni nj gs nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz fk bk">Data teams, however, are not so fortunate. While the initial months of a data platform’s lifecycle are often marked by the excitement of tackling complex technical challenges and the joy of delivering a first wave of data products, what often follows is a daunting spiral of mounting complexity, rising costs, and diminishing returns.</p><p id="739e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fr ng b gp nh ni nj gs nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz fk bk">Unlike other problems that we need to navigate as data teams, our scalability struggles are inherently different from the ones faced by software teams. In the data world, these struggles come in the form of unavoidable technical complexity (like mixing a multitude of patterns to move and transform data across an ever-growing list of systems) and the data platform’s unique positioning within the company (since eventually every business unit gets connected to it either directly or indirectly).</p><p id="9adb" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fr ng b gp nh ni nj gs nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz fk bk">So, <a class="af nd" href="https://benn.substack.com/p/the-problem-was-the-product" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">in this post-MDS world</a>, where data teams are thoroughly scrutinized over their spending and continuously asked to showcase their value, it is more important than ever to define standards and tenets for successfully scaling a data platform. This article will focus on five principles critical to achieving this while also offering strategies for applying them.</p></div></div></div><div class="ab cb oa ob oc od" role="separator"><span class="oe by bm of og oh"/><span class="oe by bm of og oh"/><span class="oe by bm of og"/></div><div class="fk fl fm fn fo"><div class="ab cb"><div class="ci bh ew ex ey ez"><h1 id="cea6" class="oi oj fr bf ok ol om gr on oo op gu oq or os ot ou ov ow ox oy oz pa pb pc pd bk">1. Don’t lose sight of what matters (i.e. business value)</h1><p id="0cfe" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fr ng b gp pe ni nj gs pf nl nm nn pg np nq nr ph nt nu nv pi nx ny nz fk bk">In most cases, data platforms have the potential to be one of the company’s most valuable assets. However, in their journey towards proving their value, it is unfortunately very common for data teams to focus on the <em class="pj">what</em> instead of the <em class="pj">why</em>.</p><p id="a7be" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fr ng b gp nh ni nj gs nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz fk bk">If you go through the data content available on the web, you’ll mostly come across complex data architectures or praise/criticism of certain technologies. On the other hand, content that focuses on enabling downstream use cases or measuring the impact of data initiatives is relatively rare. I consider this a symptom of a key problem that data teams need to address: <strong class="ng fs">we quickly get too focused on what we’re building and lose sight of why we’re building it</strong>.</p><p id="3426" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fr ng b gp nh ni nj gs nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz fk bk">This problem can eventually lead data teams to the path of building for the sake of building. Instead, the more scalable approach is to be on the hunt for value-generating data initiatives and to continuously reflect on (and measure when possible) the value being generated. To do so, I recommend the following four strategies:</p><h2 id="9d5e" class="pk oj fr bf ok pl pm pn on po pp pq oq nn pr ps pt nr pu pv pw nv px py pz qa bk"><strong class="al">Figure out which data matters (Not all data is created equal)</strong></h2><p id="cfa9" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fr ng b gp pe ni nj gs pf nl nm nn pg np nq nr ph nt nu nv pi nx ny nz fk bk">Since today’s technologies make it extremely easy to generate, store, and transform massive amounts of data, data teams can quickly get overwhelmed by the rapidly increasing number of datasets they have to support. However, the amount of attention you should give to a dataset must be based on its importance, which is determined by connecting it to its downstream use cases.</p><h2 id="1ae2" class="pk oj fr bf ok pl pm pn on po pp pq oq nn pr ps pt nr pu pv pw nv px py pz qa bk"><strong class="al">Connect every initiative/project to the value it’s going to generate</strong></h2><p id="fd57" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fr ng b gp pe ni nj gs pf nl nm nn pg np nq nr ph nt nu nv pi nx ny nz fk bk">Before a data project is greenlit, it should be evaluated for the business value it will generate (directly or indirectly). This important exercise ensures alignment with your stakeholders and allows you to map your data projects to downstream initiatives. Writing <a class="af nd" rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="/writing-design-docs-for-data-pipelines-d49550f95580">design docs</a> for data pipelines and other types of data components is a great approach to ensure that what you’re building aligns with clearly defined business goals and metrics.</p><h2 id="79dd" class="pk oj fr bf ok pl pm pn on po pp pq oq nn pr ps pt nr pu pv pw nv px py pz qa bk"><strong class="al">Continuously look for new high-impact use cases</strong></h2><p id="7e85" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fr ng b gp pe ni nj gs pf nl nm nn pg np nq nr ph nt nu nv pi nx ny nz fk bk">Data teams commonly rely on receiving requests and potential projects from other departments and business units. Although it may be tempting to rely on such processes, you should always be on the lookout for potentially value-generating areas in which data can be leveraged. Whether it’s an internal data product or a data app that can be embedded within the company’s product, key use cases might slip away simply because the data team was building things in its own corner.</p><h2 id="d551" class="pk oj fr bf ok pl pm pn on po pp pq oq nn pr ps pt nr pu pv pw nv px py pz qa bk"><strong class="al">Frequently ask for feedback from your users</strong></h2><p id="7892" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fr ng b gp pe ni nj gs pf nl nm nn pg np nq nr ph nt nu nv pi nx ny nz fk bk">It’s easy for data teams to focus on the wrong metrics. For example, elevated usage might give us a sense of accomplishment. However, in a data-driven environment, people need data across the board — so elevated usage doesn’t necessarily mean that everything is going great or that the usage is going into value-generating use cases. As the platform scales, cracks will eventually show (ranging from data quality problems to low development speed), and being disconnected from your users means that you’ll have to play catch-up to gain their trust again. Instead, try to frequently ask for feedback, whether via embedded feedback mechanisms in the tools you offer or a simple feedback form that you send to users every few months.</p><h1 id="6d90" class="oi oj fr bf ok ol qb gr on oo qc gu oq or qd ot ou ov qe ox oy oz qf pb pc pd bk">2. Automated standards are your best friend</h1><p id="9608" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fr ng b gp pe ni nj gs pf nl nm nn pg np nq nr ph nt nu nv pi nx ny nz fk bk">One of the biggest challenges of scaling a data platform is getting pulled in many directions. Whether it’s due to the influx of projects that require new data components or the endless stream of ad-hoc requests, there will come a time in the data team’s journey when they become a bottleneck. That time usually leads to an unfortunate decision: adopting a self-serve model without setting the right foundations for it. This means that other teams get to build their own datasets or pipelines to generate insights — which starts well until someone eventually realizes that no dataset can be trusted anymore.</p><figure class="mn mo mp mq mr ms mk ml paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="mt mu ed mv bh mw"><div class="mk ml qg"><img src="../Images/e81c19f270750bc99b9fba19e99fdd99.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*xl-gxuMamXXDapu_ekbVmw.png"/></div></div><figcaption class="my mz na mk ml nb nc bf b bg z dx">The pitfalls of adopting a self-serve approach without governance (image by author)</figcaption></figure><p id="b164" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fr ng b gp nh ni nj gs nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz fk bk">The recommendation here isn’t to avoid self-serve. Instead, you should define standards for how things should be done and automate their enforcement as much as possible. These standards can include basic things like table/column/model naming conventions and mandatory documentation or more nuanced approaches like mandatory tests and only using governed datasets in production pipelines.</p><p id="2c2e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fr ng b gp nh ni nj gs nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz fk bk">Applying such standards — via Continuous Integration (CI) automation for example — ensures a minimum of consistency and prevents scenarios in which the data platform eventually becomes a data mess or swamp.</p><p id="6132" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fr ng b gp nh ni nj gs nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz fk bk">However, it’s important to note that the standards you choose to apply should have a concrete business justification and shouldn’t impact the development speed without tangible benefits. The right balance between standardization and iteration/delivery speed depends on the company’s context and the use cases in which the data is being used, but in all cases, a minimum of standardization is required.</p><h1 id="7190" class="oi oj fr bf ok ol qb gr on oo qc gu oq or qd ot ou ov qe ox oy oz qf pb pc pd bk">3. Frequently ask yourself whether you have the right tools for the current scale</h1><p id="81bf" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fr ng b gp pe ni nj gs pf nl nm nn pg np nq nr ph nt nu nv pi nx ny nz fk bk">As an engineer myself, I know how easy it is to get too attached to the neat package you built to do X or the open-source project you leveraged (and maybe contributed to) to do Y. But as your data platform grows in scale, routinely revisiting your architecture to identify areas where the tooling needs an upgrade (or a downgrade) is an important exercise.</p><p id="f4a3" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fr ng b gp nh ni nj gs nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz fk bk">Migrations have a cost, of course, and they’re always tricky — but performing them at the right time and <a class="af nd" href="https://lethain.com/migrations/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">having a playbook for replacing components of your platform</a> is a critical skill for every data team. To assess which tools may not be suitable for your current scale, I think it’s essential to have an up-to-date, high-level answer to the following questions for every component within your stack:</p><ul class=""><li id="3239" class="ne nf fr ng b gp nh ni nj gs nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz qh qi qj bk">How much does it cost? (In terms of the engineering time to maintain it, its infra costs, its pricing, etc.) Is this cost acceptable to us? How will this cost evolve throughout the next year?</li><li id="4c36" class="ne nf fr ng b gp qk ni nj gs ql nl nm nn qm np nq nr qn nt nu nv qo nx ny nz qh qi qj bk">Are we spending resources (engineering time, money, etc.) on it that would deliver more business value if spent elsewhere?</li><li id="727f" class="ne nf fr ng b gp qk ni nj gs ql nl nm nn qm np nq nr qn nt nu nv qo nx ny nz qh qi qj bk">Does it have all the main features we currently need and the ones we’ll need in the next year? If not, are there other options that deliver the features we’re looking for? If such other options exist, what would the migration cost be?</li></ul><p id="b5d8" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fr ng b gp nh ni nj gs nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz fk bk">By doing this exercise, you’ll definitely come across areas where you can decommission things altogether (like pipelines or tools that are not providing any meaningful value), others where you need to replace one system with another one (maybe you built a real-time ingestion process but all the current business-critical consumption scenarios only require batch), and finally areas where you need an upgrade (like moving from an in-house data movement process to an established tool that comes with more features out-of-the-box).</p><p id="fc33" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fr ng b gp nh ni nj gs nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz fk bk">As a more practical example, even though dbt tests are a great starting point to ensure data quality for your key assets and allow consumers to trust the data they use, they quickly reach the limit of their usefulness as you add more systems to your data platform and start supporting production (or even operational) use cases. Once the effort you spend on data incidents and debugging data issues starts impacting your roadmap, it may be time to upgrade from dbt tests to a data observability component.</p><h1 id="6ff6" class="oi oj fr bf ok ol qb gr on oo qc gu oq or qd ot ou ov qe ox oy oz qf pb pc pd bk">4. Don’t be too ambitious (prioritize your problems)</h1><p id="567b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fr ng b gp pe ni nj gs pf nl nm nn pg np nq nr ph nt nu nv pi nx ny nz fk bk">This principle goes hand-in-hand with the above one. Just like it’s extremely important to perform migrations when needed, it’s even more important to avoid making unnecessary ones.</p><p id="4808" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fr ng b gp nh ni nj gs nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz fk bk">The current pace at which the data space is progressing means that new technologies, paradigms, and architectures are a constant. Tech behemoths are constantly rethinking their approaches to data, and no matter how much you try, most of your platform will always be a few steps behind the data pioneers. This isn’t, however, a bad thing.</p><p id="3976" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fr ng b gp nh ni nj gs nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz fk bk">As you reflect on the current state of the art and try to identify gaps in your platform, the guiding light should be the business value you expect to generate via the upgrade. Sure, capability X sounds nice on paper, but which specific business use cases does it solve, and which other initiatives can you spend the migration effort on?</p><p id="7e70" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fr ng b gp nh ni nj gs nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz fk bk">I believe that it’s crucial to stay up-to-date with the state of the art in the field and read about the journeys of other data teams, but the decision to adopt a new tool or paradigm always needs to be based on the expected business value. Additionally, it’s critical to always have your business priorities in mind and update them accordingly as the environment around the data team changes.</p><h1 id="7ded" class="oi oj fr bf ok ol qb gr on oo qc gu oq or qd ot ou ov qe ox oy oz qf pb pc pd bk">5. Shift some of the responsibility left (and right)</h1><p id="80d4" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fr ng b gp pe ni nj gs pf nl nm nn pg np nq nr ph nt nu nv pi nx ny nz fk bk">Once you cover the above areas, and especially once the data platform starts supporting high-impact projects, the data team can start shifting into a <em class="pj">platform team </em>role. This means that you can confidently start adding more nuance to ownership and relieve the data team from the burden of managing business metrics and source data issues.</p><p id="33b1" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fr ng b gp nh ni nj gs nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz fk bk">The timing of this transition is critical since the decentralization of responsibilities can only succeed if you have already built the right foundations:</p><ul class=""><li id="37d1" class="ne nf fr ng b gp nh ni nj gs nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz qh qi qj bk">Making the data platform a value-generating system that is critical to the success of the business (and so other teams are incentivized to invest their time in data-related work)</li><li id="b827" class="ne nf fr ng b gp qk ni nj gs ql nl nm nn qm np nq nr qn nt nu nv qo nx ny nz qh qi qj bk">Standardizing the different processes, defining clear interfaces, and minimizing the amount of guess-work done by the teams that contribute to the platform (as producers, consumers, or contributors)</li><li id="8157" class="ne nf fr ng b gp qk ni nj gs ql nl nm nn qm np nq nr qn nt nu nv qo nx ny nz qh qi qj bk">Having the right toolset that allows you to onboard new teams and navigate a more complex structure</li></ul><p id="34f0" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fr ng b gp nh ni nj gs nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz fk bk">Additionally, instead of trying to transition all of your data products to a decentralized model in one go, you’ll increase your chances of success if you perform the transition in stages. First, start by identifying the most critical datasets and data pipelines, for which you can:</p><ul class=""><li id="9301" class="ne nf fr ng b gp nh ni nj gs nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz qh qi qj bk">Establish contracts with the data producers</li><li id="2b51" class="ne nf fr ng b gp qk ni nj gs ql nl nm nn qm np nq nr qn nt nu nv qo nx ny nz qh qi qj bk">Move the ownership of metrics definition to the corresponding business teams</li></ul><p id="2a4e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fr ng b gp nh ni nj gs nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz fk bk">Once this first initiative succeeds, you can start widening the range of pipelines that adhere to the new model based on their importance to the business. It’s completely fine not to apply this model to all datasets — if a data pipeline doesn’t have a meaningful business use case yet, it doesn’t need to be highly governed.</p><figure class="mn mo mp mq mr ms mk ml paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="mt mu ed mv bh mw"><div class="mk ml qp"><img src="../Images/cc9fd8a84493e6387e80a7318a8cba24.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*jKymkRARRgFgOZa5rbAQOQ.png"/></div></div><figcaption class="my mz na mk ml nb nc bf b bg z dx">Sample data platform functioning at scale (image by author)</figcaption></figure><p id="68f2" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fr ng b gp nh ni nj gs nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz fk bk">The above points are, ultimately, the culmination of the first four principles discussed in this article. Many decentralization / data mesh initiatives fail either because the right foundations are lacking or the data team attempts to make a very optimistic (and unrealistic) transition from a completely centralized to a decentralized approach instead of performing the shift in stages.</p></div></div></div><div class="ab cb oa ob oc od" role="separator"><span class="oe by bm of og oh"/><span class="oe by bm of og oh"/><span class="oe by bm of og"/></div><div class="fk fl fm fn fo"><div class="ab cb"><div class="ci bh ew ex ey ez"><p id="071b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fr ng b gp nh ni nj gs nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz fk bk">In this article, we explored five principles for successfully scaling your data platform and turning it into a value-generating component as it grows in size, complexity, and importance. Their application doesn’t require you to use specific tools or technologies. Instead, they’re guidelines that can be universally applied when working on data projects (except for certain edge cases / niche industries).</p><p id="e832" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fr ng b gp nh ni nj gs nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz fk bk">The end state that we discussed, which is a hybrid setup between a centralized approach (in which the data team owns the platform end-to-end) and a decentralized / data mesh one (in which different teams build and own their data products end-to-end), elevates your chances of successfully scaling the platform as you transition from one approach to another — but its suitability for your team would also depend on your industry and the context in which you’re operating.</p><p id="a003" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fr ng b gp nh ni nj gs nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz fk bk">Finally, if there’s just one principle/rule to remember, then make it this one: <strong class="ng fs">It’s extremely important to frequently reevaluate your approach and the path you’re on. What got you from 0 to 1 is very different from what would get you from 1 to 10 (and so on).</strong> This is more of a universal principle that I believe is especially relevant for data platforms.</p></div></div></div><div class="ab cb oa ob oc od" role="separator"><span class="oe by bm of og oh"/><span class="oe by bm of og oh"/><span class="oe by bm of og"/></div><div class="fk fl fm fn fo"><div class="ab cb"><div class="ci bh ew ex ey ez"><p id="dbe3" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ne nf fr ng b gp nh ni nj gs nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz fk bk"><em class="pj">For more data engineering content you can subscribe to my newsletter, Data Espresso, in which I discuss various topics related to data engineering and technology in general:</em></p><div class="qq qr qs qt qu qv"><a href="https://dataespresso.substack.com/?source=post_page-----c16df72f5463--------------------------------" rel="noopener  ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><div class="qw ab ih"><div class="qx ab co cb qy qz"><h2 class="bf fs hx z ip ra ir is rb iu iw fq bk">Data Espresso | Mahdi Karabiben | Substack</h2><div class="rc l"><h3 class="bf b hx z ip ra ir is rb iu iw dx">Data engineering updates and commentary to accompany your afternoon espresso.
