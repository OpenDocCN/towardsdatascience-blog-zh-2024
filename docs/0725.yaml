    [DevDay conference](https://devday.openai.com/) on November 6, 2023\. Here's what
    they said on their [corresponding blog](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts)

- en: We’re rolling out custom versions of ChatGPT that you can create for a specific
    purpose — called GPTs. GPTs are a new way for anyone to create a tailored version
    of ChatGPT to be more helpful in their daily life, at specific tasks, at work,
    or at home — and then share that creation with others. For example, GPTs can help
    you learn the rules to any board game, help teach your kids math, or design stickers.

    you must have a GPT Plus or Enterprise account to use the new GPTs. The cost starts
    at US$20 per month. However, if other GPT Plus users interact with your custom
    GPT, OpenAI pays you a small royalty based on the number of user interactions.'
