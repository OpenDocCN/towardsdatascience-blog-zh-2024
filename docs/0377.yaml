- en: When it comes to applying machine learning to physical system modeling, it is
    more and more common to see practitioners moving away from a pure data-driven
    strategy, and starting to embrace a hybrid mindset, where rich prior physical
    knowledge (e.g., governing differential equations) is used together with the data
    to augment the model training.

    as a versatile concept and led to many success stories in effectively solving
    real-world challenges.

- en: As a practitioner who is eager to adopt PINNs, I am keen on learning both the
    latest developments in training algorithms, as well as the **novel use cases**
    of PINNs for real-world applications. However, a pain point I often see is that,
    although there are abundant research papers/blogs summarizing effective PINN algorithms,
    overviews of novel use cases of PINNs can rarely be found. One obvious reason
    is that, unlike the training algorithms which are domain-agnostic, reports of
    PINN use cases are scattered in various engineering domains and not readily accessible
    for a practitioner who is usually an expert in one specific domain. As a consequence,
    I often found myself…
