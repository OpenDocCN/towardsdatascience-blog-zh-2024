[/INST] Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) and\ncomputer science that deals with the interaction between computers and human language. Its main objective is to read, decipher, \nunderstand, and make sense of the human language in a valuable way. It can be used for various tasks such as speech recognition, \ntext-to-speech synthesis, sentiment analysis, machine translation, part-of-speech tagging, name entity recognition, \nsummarization, and question-answering systems. NLP technology allows machines to recognize, understand,\n and respond to human language in a more natural and intuitive way, making interactions more accessible and efficient.</s>\n```"]
