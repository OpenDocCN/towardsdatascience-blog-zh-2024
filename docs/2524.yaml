    This is the causal question a Marketing-Mix-Model should answer in order to guide
    companies in deciding how to attribute their marketing channel budgets in the
    future. As we will see, the results to this question highly depend on which variables
    you account for: Omitting important variables, or including “wrong” variables
    in your model will introduce bias and lead to wrong causal estimates. This is
    a huge problem, as wrong causal estimates will eventually turn into bad marketing
    decisions and financial losses. In this article, I want to address this issue
    and give guidance on how to determine which variables should and should not be
    taken into account in your MMM, with the following structure:'

    up, it looks like the additional Sales generated by the *World Cup* are generated
    by the additional *TV* adds, when they are in fact largely due to the *World Cup*.
    This leads to a biased estimate of TV on sales. But luckily, this bias disappears

    This is due to the fact that the linear model confuses the causal effect of *TV*
    with the effect of the *World Cup*, which leads to a bias. On the right hand side,
    the estimated effect of *TV* is now substantially smaller, because the model rightly

- en: In order to identify all confounders, you need to know all factors that have
    both a causal impact on your marketing channels, and on your company’s sales.
    A huge difficulty here is that the concept of causality is very theoretical, and
    only resides on assumptions! Hence, there is no way of knowing which variables
    have a causal impact just by looking at the data. You need to think conceptually,
    about which variables could impact sales and your marketing channel spendings.
    While it will be nearly impossible to list all factors that could have a causal
    impact on sales, as these are very diverse (e.g. inflation, state of economy,
    competition…), it should be much easier to identify the factors that influence
    your channel spendings, as these decisions / processes are made within your company,
    and can thus be investigated by talking to the relevant persons internally! In
    the end, if you identify the subset of factors that impact both channel spendings
    and sales, you’re good!

    also observe that taking into account the mediator variable leads to significant
    biases as well. For instance, we estimate the impact of the youtube channel less
    than half its real value when taking into account the variable visits into the
    MMM.

    unbiased causal estimates in Marketing Mix Modeling. As we could see in our example,
    not accounting for confounders or including variables such as mediators or colliders
    can significantly distort the results of your MMM, leading to misguided marketing
    decisions and potential financial losses. This should underline the importance
    of deeply think about the causal relationships involved between the variables
    you model. Once these are identified, you now know which variables you should
    take into account and which not to get unbiased channels estimates! For diving
    deeper, I highly recommend taking a read of the causal inference literature attached.
