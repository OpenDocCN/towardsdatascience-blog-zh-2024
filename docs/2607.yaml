- en: Collecting a dataset where each class has exactly the same number of class to
    predict can be a challenge. In reality, things are rarely perfectly balanced,
    and when you are making a classification model, this can be an issue. When a model
    is trained on such dataset, where one class has more examples than the other,
    it has usually become better at predicting the bigger groups and worse at predicting
    the smaller ones. To help with this issue, we can use tactics like oversampling
    and undersampling — creating more examples of the smaller group or removing some
    examples from the bigger group.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are many different oversampling and undersampling methods (with intimidating
    names like SMOTE, ADASYN, and Tomek Links) out there but there doesn’t seem to
    be many resources that visually compare how they work. So, here, we will use one
    simple 2D dataset to show the changes that occur in the data after applying those
    methods so we can see how different the output of each method is. You will see
    in the visuals that these various approaches give different solutions, and who
    knows, one might be suitable for your specific machine learning challenge!

    than the other. The way it works is by making more copies of the examples from

    the bigger group until it’s almost the same in size to the smaller group. In the
    end, the dataset is smaller, sure, but both groups will have a more similar number
    of examples.

- en: Combining oversampling and undersampling can be called “hybrid sampling”. It
    increases the size of the smaller group by making more copies of its examples
    and also, it removes some of example of the bigger group by removing some of its
    examples. It tries to create a dataset that is more balanced — not too big and
    not too small.
