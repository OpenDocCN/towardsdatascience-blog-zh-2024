    we faced was resource planning and forecasting. My team and I constantly struggled
    with this aspect, often improvising and constantly putting out fires üöí. Just merely
    reacting to the situation, with the hope of finding a solution. But as Mark Wahlberg
    says in his movies ‚Äú*Hope ain‚Äôt a tactic*‚Äù.

    a substitute for thinking several steps ahead and planning to the end.‚Äù

    know it at the time ü§î. In fact acquiring the skills to solve such problems was
    one of my main motivations for continuing my studies. This article explores a
    specific application of mathematical optimization and how it could have made my
    job substantially easier back then. I guess that I am making this article as a
    gift üéÅ to my past-self.
