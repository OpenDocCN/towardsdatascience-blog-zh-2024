- en: As a data scientist, it frequently happens to me that I need a quick and dirty
    estimate of how a predictive model would perform on a given dataset. For a long
    time, I did this through cross-validation. Then, I realized I was completely off
    track. Indeed,

    think it’s very relevant to take a deep dive into this topic.

    go through the reasons why cross-validation is never a good choice when dealing
    with real-world problems.

    of how a model trained on a dataset will perform on a new (unseen) set of data.
