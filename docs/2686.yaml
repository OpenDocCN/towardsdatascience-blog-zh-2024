    uncountable Medium articles about stuff like statistics, ETLs, Python vs Scala
    and what-not, I realized that someday I wanted to be the person making that kind
    of content and teaching about data and tech.

    for companies that started exploring the field of data analysis and engineering.
    Times in which people didnâ€™t really know the difference between a data scientist,
    a data analyst and a data engineer.

    Engineering at a local university â€” the [Instituto TecnolÃ³gico de Buenos Aires](https://www.itba.edu.ar).
    I was thrilled! I was going to step up and start teaching live classes with students!
