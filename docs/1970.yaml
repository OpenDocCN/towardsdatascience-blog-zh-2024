    month. But beneath the surface, a troubling trend emerges. Churn is increasing
    — *we’re losing clients* — and while the balance sheet shows impressive growth,
    revenue isn’t keeping pace with expectations. This disconnect might not be an
    issue now, but it will become one when investors start demanding profitability:
    in the tech world, acquiring a new customer costs way more than retaining an existing
    one.'

    that will help us understand not only who might leave, but also what actions to
    take on each customer to retain them — if they’re retainable at all of course.
    It goes beyond traditional predictive modeling by focusing on the incremental

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Usually, companies try to anticipate a customer behavior, churn for example.
    In order to do that they model a probability of churning per user. They are “outcome”
    modeling, meaning estimating the likelihood that a user will take a specific action.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'For example, if an outcome model estimates a 90% probability of churn for a
    particular user. In that case, the company may try to contact the given user to
    prevent them from leaving them, right? This is already a big step, and could help
    significantly lowering the churn or identifying its root causes. But here’s a
    tricky part: what if some users we identify actually want to leave, but just haven’t
    bothered to call or unsubscribe? They might leverage this call to actually churn
    instead of staying with us!'

    that directly measures the incremental impact of a treatment — or action — on
    an individual’s behavior.** Meaning that we’ll model the probability of a user
    staying if contacted by the above company, for instance.
  prefs: []

    this approach- which is quite impressive, I must say — it’s crucial to address
    it. As one might expect, the answer is multifaceted, and there are several methods
    for data scientists to evaluate a model’s ability to predict the incremental impact
    of an action.

    **cumulative incremental gain** against the proportion of the targeted population.

    outcomes can you achieve by targeting X% of the population using your model compared
    to random targeting?* We typically compare the Qini curve of an uplift model against
    that of a random targeting strategy to simulate what would happen if we had no
    uplift model and were targeting users or customers at random. When building an
    uplift model, it’s considered best practice to compare the Qini curves of all
    models to identify the most effective one on unseen data. However, we’ll delve
    deeper into this in our technical articles.'

    by identifying which users will respond most positively to your intervention.
    For example, you might achieve 80% of the total positive outcomes by reaching
    out to just 50% of your users. While this approach may not always outperform contacting
    everyone, it can significantly lower your costs while maintaining a high level
    of impact. The key benefit is efficiency: achieving nearly the same results with
    fewer resources.'

    total impact than by reaching out to everyone. It does this by identifying not
