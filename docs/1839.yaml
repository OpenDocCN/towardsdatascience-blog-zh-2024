    Learning Engineer** in a startup, I have a Master’s Degree in **Physics** and
    I’m about to defend my dissertation for my PhD in **Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering**.
    During my ever-changing career, two things stayed the same: my love for science
    and my passion for coding.'

- en: A beautiful way to mix science and coding is by doing **modeling**. What I mean
    by that is that, in order to describe the world, you make a reasonable assumption
    based on some degree of approximation of reality. Based on this assumption and
    on your starting approximation, we can **simulate a given process**. The simulation
    will give us some results that stem from the original assumptions but that weren’t
    exactly predictable before the simulation itself.

    Then we approximate the fence to be a bigger square…
