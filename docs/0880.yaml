    I discussed the mathematics you need to become a high-caliber data scientist.
    In a nutshell, you need to know three key areas: Linear Algebra, Calculus, and
    Statistics.'

    is the backbone of many data science principles, you will use it every single
    day and even machine learning came from statistical learning theory.

    you should have as a data scientist and resources to learn all these things.

    it, especially with all the active research going on. However, if you have a solid
    working knowledge of the topics I will go over in this article, then you are in
    a very strong position.

    article summarises the whole statistics landscape.
