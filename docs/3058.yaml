- en: We are living in an era of superlatives. Each year, month, week, new advancements
    in machine learning research are announced. The number of (ML) papers added to
    arXiv is growing equally fast. More than 11 000 papers have been [added last October
    in the *Computer Science* Category](https://info.arxiv.org/about/reports/submission_category_by_year.html).

- en: Similarly, large machine learning conferences are seeing ever-growing number
    of submissions — so many in fact, that, to ensure a fair reviewing process, submitting
    authors are required to serve as reviewers for other submissions (called *reciprocal
    reviewing*).

    or benchmarks. As a beginner in Machine Learning, it’s difficult to even get started:
    the amount of information is overwhelming. In a previous article, [I argued that
    and why ML beginners should read papers](/ml-beginners-should-read-papers-506a074ffc10).
    The quintessence is that good research papers are self-contained lectures that
    hone analytical thinking.'

    papers to read, a point that I did not fully elaborate previously. Over 7 steps,
    I guide you through the possible process of finding and reading interesting papers.
