    recently solved difficult high school-level math problems that stump most humans.
    By combining deep learning neural networks with logical symbolic reasoning, AlphaGeometry
    charts an exciting direction for developing more human-like thinking.

- en: The key innovation underlying AlphaGeometry is its “neuro-symbolic” architecture
    integrating neural learning components and formal symbolic deduction engines.
    As the researchers from DeepMind explain, theorem proving tasks like geometry
    construction problems require both *(i)* flexible neural creative reasoning to
    infer implicit relationships and introduce new steps, and *(ii)* logically rigorous
    rule-based deduction to reliably build chains of sound inferences.

    challenges. But together, they achieve impressive synergies not possible with
    either paradigm alone.
