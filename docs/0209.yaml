- en: There is a brand new language called Mojo that appeared in 2023 and became very
    eye-catching quickly. It was created by Chris Lattner, the original architect
    of the Swift programming language. Mojo is designed to be a superset of Python.
    The syntax is very similar to Python and thus very friendly to Python developers.

- en: Mojo is a compiled language and is magnitudes faster than Python. It’s specifically
    optimized for ML/AI-related calculations and thus can be interesting and helpful
    to learn for common Python developers.

    with their counterparts in Python. I’m sure you will be surprised by its syntax
    and efficiency when compared with Python.

- en: Mojo is currently a proprietary programming language developed by the AI company
    [Modular](https://www.modular.com/), whose goal is to build an extensible and
    unified AI platform that removes complexity and adds flexibility and speed to
    AI development. And Mojo is the new language developed for this platform to solve
    the AI infrastructure scaling and acceleration issues. It is the first programming
    language built with [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/), a compiler infrastructure…
