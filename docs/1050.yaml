    woman asks questions and then waits for the man to answer while taking some notes.
    It might seem like a normal conversation. Yet, it is anything but ordinary. Inside
    the woman’s notebook, the man’s answers are always the same regardless of the
    date written on each page. Although the conversations take place in the 80’s,
    the answers referred to events that happened more than 10 years before. [Jenni
    Ogden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenni_Ogden) was one of the first researchers
    to talk to patient H.M. who, years later, became widely known for his impact on
    neuropsychology and would finally be addressed by his real name [Henry Molaison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Molaison).
    After years of interviews and tests, researchers concluded that Henry had lost
    the ability to generate new memories due to a lobotomy procedure he had when he
    was 27 years old. Henry’s case helped to better understand the connection between
    brain function and memory and to coin the concept of short- and long-term memory.
    This concept paved the way for groundbreaking research in the field of Machine
    Learning where scientists and developers try to find in the mysterious inner workings
    of the brain, a better way to build predictive models.
