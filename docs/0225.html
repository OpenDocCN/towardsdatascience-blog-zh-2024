From ancient practices harvesting organic cacao in the Amazon basin, to chocolatiers sculpting edible art in the mountains of Switzerland, and enormous factories in Hershey, Pennsylvania churning out 70 million kisses per day, the nuanced forms and flavors of chocolate have been integrated into many cultures and their customs. While quality can greatly vary across chocolate products, a well-known, shelf-stable, easily shareable form of chocolate are M&amp;Ms. Readily found by convenience store check-out counters and in hotel vending machines, the brightly colored pellets are a popular treat whose packaging is re-branded to fit nearly any commercializable American holiday.</p><p id="dd17" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">While living in Denmark in 2022, I heard a concerning claim: M&amp;Ms manufactured in Europe taste different, and arguably “better,” than M&amp;Ms produced in the United States. While I recognized that fancy European chocolate is indeed quite tasty and often superior to American chocolate, it was unclear to me if the same claim should hold for M&amp;Ms. I learned that many Europeans perceive an “unpleasant” or “tangy” taste in American chocolate, which is largely attributed to <a class="af pr" href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/podcasts/butyric-acid/1017662.article" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">butyric acid</a>, a compound resulting from differences in how milk is treated before incorporation into milk chocolate.</p><p id="fedd" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">But honestly, how much of a difference could this make for M&amp;Ms? <em class="ny">M&amp;Ms!</em>? I imagined M&amp;Ms would retain a relatively processed/mass-produced/cheap candy flavor wherever they were manufactured. As the lone American visiting a diverse lab of international scientists pursuing cutting-edge research in biosustainability, I was inspired to break out my data science toolbox and investigate this M&amp;M flavor phenomenon.</p><h2 id="d6a8" class="ov oa fq bf ob ow ox oy oe oz pa pb oh nl pc pd pe np pf pg ph nt pi pj pk pl bk">1.2 Previous work</h2><p id="c030" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go pm ng nh gr pn nj nk nl po nn no np pp nr ns nt pq nv nw nx fj bk">To quote a European woman, who shall remain anonymous, after she tasted an American M&amp;M while traveling in New York:</p><blockquote class="ps"><p id="7a35" class="pt pu fq bf pv pw px py pz qa qb nx dx">“They taste so gross.

In my experience, children raised in the United States had no qualms about eating M&amp;Ms. Growing up, I was accustomed to bowls of M&amp;Ms strategically placed in high traffic areas around my house to provide readily available sugar.

But are they significantly different and/or inferior to their European equivalent?</p><p id="3cbe" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">In response to the anonymous European woman’s scathing report, myself and two other Americans visiting Denmark sampled M&amp;Ms purchased locally in the Lyngby Storcenter Føtex.

This would be expected if the taste difference between European-sourced and American-sourced M&amp;Ms is not actually all that perceptible. Most inconsistent were participants who gave the same M&amp;M type “Good”, “Normal”, <em class="ny">and</em> “Bad” responses (e.g., points high on the y-axis, with wider standard deviations of taste scores), indicating lower taste perception abilities.</p><p id="a6ed" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">Intriguingly, four participants — one from each continent group — were perfectly consistent: they reported the same taste response for each of the 5 M&amp;Ms from each M&amp;M type, resulting in an average standard deviation of 0.0 (bottom of Figure 9). Excluding the one of the four who simply rated all 10 M&amp;Ms as “Normal”, the other three appeared to be “Perfect Classifiers” — either rating all M&amp;Ms of one type “Good” and the other “Normal”, or rating all M&amp;Ms of one type “Normal” and the other “Bad.” Perhaps these folks are “super tasters.”</p><h2 id="811c" class="ov oa fq bf ob ow ox oy oe oz pa pb oh nl pc pd pe np pf pg ph nt pi pj pk pl bk">3.6 M&amp;M color</h2><p id="61a6" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go pm ng nh gr pn nj nk nl po nn no np pp nr ns nt pq nv nw nx fj bk">Another possible explanation for the inconsistency in individual taste responses is that there exists a perceptible taste difference based on the M&amp;M color. Visually, the USA M&amp;Ms were noticeably more smooth and vibrant than the Denmark M&amp;Ms, which were somewhat more “splotchy” in appearance (Figure 10A). M&amp;M color was recorded during the experiment, and although balanced sampling was not formally built into the experimental design, colors seemed to be sampled roughly evenly, with the exception of Blue USA M&amp;Ms, which were oversampled (Figure 10B).</p><figure class="mm mn mo mp mq mr mj mk paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="ms mt ed mu bh mv"><div class="mj mk qy"><img src="../Images/75dd4e165af359d0d157dc4c4d1df496.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*1MHZGfeuN3vCHrh20xb7rw.png"/></div></div><figcaption class="mx my mz mj mk na nb bf b bg z dx">Figure 10.

It’s perhaps a bit hard to perceive on screen in my unprofessionally lit photo, but with the naked eye, USA M&amp;Ms seemed to be brighter and more uniformly colored while Denmark M&amp;Ms have a duller and more mottled color.

While some participants took this to heart and occasionally spent over a minute deeply savoring each M&amp;M and evaluating it as if they were a sommelier, many participants seemed to view the experiment as a competition (which occasionally led to deflated or inflated pride). Experimenters wrote down quotes and notes in conjunction with M&amp;M responses, some of which were a bit “colorful.” We provide a hastily rendered word cloud for each M&amp;M type for entertainment purposes (Figure 12) though we caution against reading too far into them without diligent sentiment analysis.</p><figure class="mm mn mo mp mq mr mj mk paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="ms mt ed mu bh mv"><div class="mj mk ra"><img src="../Images/39505a3bcd94882106d90bdbdb41d065.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*UlSrCAKuoCKdAJSuNAUaHw.png"/></div></div><figcaption class="mx my mz mj mk na nb bf b bg z dx">Figure 11.

Conclusion</h1><p id="a923" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go pm ng nh gr pn nj nk nl po nn no np pp nr ns nt pq nv nw nx fj bk">Overall, there does not appear to be a “global consensus” that European M&amp;Ms are better than American M&amp;Ms. However, European participants tended to more strongly express negative reactions to USA M&amp;Ms while North American participants seemed relatively split on whether they preferred M&amp;Ms sourced from the USA vs from Europe. The preference trends of Asian participants often fell somewhere between the North Americans and Europeans.</p><p id="cf1a" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">Therefore, I’ll admit that it’s probable that Europeans are not engaged in a grand coordinated lie about M&amp;Ms. The skew of most European participants towards Denmark M&amp;Ms is compelling, especially since I was the experimenter who personally collected much of the taste response data. If they found a way to cheat, it was done well enough to exceed my own passive perception such that I didn’t notice. However, based on this study, it would appear that a strongly negative “vomit flavor” is not universally perceived and does not become apparent to non-Europeans when tasting both M&amp;Ms types side by side.</p><p id="496e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nc nd fq ne b go nf ng nh gr ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx fj bk">We hope this study has been illuminating!
