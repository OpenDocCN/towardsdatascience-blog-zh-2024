    to navigate them effectively is, at best, shaky—very often through no fault of
    our own.

- en: We may want to think, like Spider-Man’s Uncle Ben, that with great power comes
    great responsibility; in the real, non-comic-book world, the two don’t always
    arrive simultaneously. The companies driving most AI innovation often rush to
    release products even when the latter have the potential to disrupt lives, careers,
    and economies and to perpetuate harmful stereotypes; responsible deployment isn’t
    always their creators’ top priority.

    future directions—we’ve put together a strong lineup of recent articles that tackle
    the topic of AI’s social footprint. From medical use cases to built-in biases,
    these posts are great conversation-starters, and might be especially helpful for
    practitioners who have only recently started to consider these questions.

    in large language models, and how this issue relates to other problems and potential
    blind spots lurking under LLMs’ shiny veneer.'

    shares findings from his recent experiments with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, tasking the
    models with generating dating profiles and playing matchmaker, and revealing varying
    degrees of racial bias along the way.

    Should it embellish history and current social structures to minimize bias in
    its representations? [Stephanie Kirmer](https://medium.com/u/a8dc77209ef3?source=post_page---user_mention--7f896fff501b--------------------------------)
    invites us to reflect on these difficult questions in the wake of Google’s multimodal
    model Gemini generating questionable outputs, like racially diverse Nazi soldiers.

    these decisions is slowly but steadily ticking.”'
