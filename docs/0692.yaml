- en: Over the past few years, we have witnessed a rapid evolution of generative large
    language models (LLMs), culminating in the creation of unprecedented tools like
    ChatGPT. Generative AI has now become a popular topic among both researchers and
    the general public. Now more than ever before, it is important that researchers
    and engineers (i.e., those *building* the technology) develop an ability to communicate
    the nuances of their creations to others. A failure to communicate the technical
    aspects of AI in an understandable and accessible manner could lead to widespread
    public skepticism (e.g., research on nuclear energy went down a [comparable path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_debate))
    or the enactment of overly-restrictive legislation that hinders forward progress
    in our field. Within this overview, we will take a small step towards solving
    these issues by proposing and outlining a simple, three-part framework for understanding
    and explaining generative LLMs.

    recently gave for O’Reilly on the basics of LLMs. The goal of this presentation
    was to provide a “primer” that brought everyone up to speed with how generative
    LLMs work. The presentation lasted ~20 minutes (hence, the title of…'
