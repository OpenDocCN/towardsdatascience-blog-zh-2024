    high gross margins — as good or better than software-as-a-service (SaaS). Often
    data businesses can be the best businesses within the industries that they serve.

    to help the investors separate the wheat from the chaff, I created a [Data Business

    and Business Models.'

    listed in the columns of the cheat sheet in order of the amount of value they
    typically create, it is important to say that many successful data businesses
    have been created based on each criterion, even the lower ranked criteria, or
    combinations thereof.

    to the value of the business, primarily in terms of building a moat versus competition
    and/or creating a meaningful point of differentiation.

- en: Generally, the best source of data is *proprietary data* that the company intentionally
    produces via a costly to replicate process such as the TV broadcast capture network
    operated by [Onclusive](http://www.onclusive.com). Sometimes a company is lucky
    enough to produce this asset as a form of data exhaust from its core business
    operations such as salary data from [Glassdoor](http://www.glassdoor.com). Data
    exhaust can be used to power another part of the same company that produces it,
    such as Amazon using purchase data to power its advertising business. Sometimes
    data exhaust is used to power a separate data business or businesses such as [NCS](https://ncsolutions.com/)
    which leverages register data from Catalina Marketing’s coupon business.

- en: A close second in terms of a valuable data source are those businesses that
    benefit from a *network effect* when gathering data. Typically, there is a give-to-get
    structure in place where each data provider gets some valuable data in return
    for the data that it supplies. When the data that everyone gets benefits from
    the participation of each incremental participant, there is a network effect.
    [TruthSet](https://www.truthset.io/) is an example of a company that runs a network
    effect empowered give-to-get model by gathering demographic data from data providers
    and returning to them ratings on the accuracy of their data.

- en: '*Data aggregation* can be a valuable way to assemble a data asset as well,
    but the value typically hinges on the difficulty of assembling the data…if it
    is too easy to do, others will do it as well and create price competition. Often
    the value comes in aggregating a long tail of data that is costly to do more than
    once either for the suppliers or a competitive aggregator. [Equilar](https://www.equilar.com/),
    for example, aggregates compensation data from innumerable corporate filings to
    create compensation benchmarking data. Interestingly, Equilar has used the data
    exhaust from its compensation data business which it sells to H.R. departments,
    to create a relationship mapping business which it sells to sales and marketing
    departments and deal oriented teams in financial service organizations.'

- en: Rounding out the set of key data sources are *Data Enrichment* and *Data Analytics*.
    Data enrichment creates value by enhancing another data source, sometimes by adding
    proprietary data, blending data with other data, structuring data, etc. Data Analytics
    companies make their mark by making sense of data from other sources often via
    insights that make mountains of data more digestible and actionable.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you can find a data set that is used *between companies*, it can be quite
    valuable because it is often difficult to displace. The best examples of this
    are when other companies trade value based on the data and the data fluctuates
    regularly. In this case, the data has become a *currency*. Examples of this include
    FICO scores from FICO or TV viewership data from Nielsen. In special occasions,
    data used between companies can also benefit from a *network effect* which tends
    to create value to the data provider. In fact, it can be the network effect that
    drives a data set to become a currency.

- en: Data that is used to power *workflows* can also be very valuable, because moving
    away from it may require customers to change the way they work. The more frequent
    and the higher value the actions and decisions supported by the data, the better.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Typically, the more numerous the users of a data set within a customer and the
    more types of companies that can make use of the data, the more valuable it is.
    One way to evaluate this is to observe how easily and often a data set is combined
    with other data sets. Relatedly, some companies make a great business out of providing
    *unique identifiers* to enable data combinations such as [Datavant](https://www.datavant.com/)
    which provides patient IDs to facilitate the exchange of healthcare data. Others,
    such as Dun & Bradstreet, use unique identifiers such as the DUNS Number, to support
    other parts of their business — credit reporting in this case.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data Nice-to-Haves are features of data businesses that typically do not sustain
    a data business on their own, but can significantly enhance the value of a data
    business. *Benchmarks / Norms* and *Historical / Longitudinal* data are typically
    attributes of data businesses that have been around for an extended period of
    time and can be difficult to replicate. The same goes for branded data though
    sometimes a brand can be extended to a new dataset once the brand is established
    — think J. D. Power applying its name to its acquisitions over the years.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Update*: One nice-to-have that I would like to call out is the company’s data
    model, i.e. the way it organizes data and the way those data elements relate to
    one another, especially how those data come together in a final deliverable or
    software / business intelligence platform. Part of the data model should, ideally,
    include a way to manage “data lineage,” i.e. an understanding of the provenance
    and uses of the data flowing through the system. Sometimes the way the data model
    is architected (data architecture) can force certain product decisions down the
    road. It can be a particular nuisance should product requirements change significantly
    or when products need to be merged together such as might be the case following
    an acquisition.'

- en: The highest gross margin data businesses are generally those employing a *syndicated*
    business model in which they are selling the same set of data over and over again
    to different parties with no customization or with configuration that is handled
    automatically, preferably by the customer. The most stable data businesses tend
    to employ a *subscription* business model in which customers subscribe to a data
    set for an extended period of time. Subscriptions models are clearly better when
    the subscriptions are long term or, at least, auto-renewing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Not surprisingly, the best data businesses are generally *syndicated subscription*
    models. On the other end, *custom* data businesses that produce data for clients
    in a one-off or project-based manner generally struggle to attain high margins
    and predictability, but can be solid businesses if the data manufacturing processes
    are optimized and they benefit from some of the other key data business attributes.

- en: The intent of this overview and associated cheat sheet are to analyze data business
    fundamentals, not to dig into typical financials. That said, typical healthy data
    businesses often have gross margins in the 65–75% range and EBITDA of 25–30%.
    Both of those number can be higher for exceptional businesses with the best of
    the characteristics above. Even in relatively slow growing industries, these businesses
    can trade at 15–18x EBITDA due to their resilience and the fact that they often
    require only modest R&D and marketing expense.

- en: My parting thought to this group of investors, who were focused on a variety
    of verticals, was that though they may not consider themselves data business experts,
    they ought to be on the lookout for great data businesses in their areas of expertise.
    It is their detailed understanding of how their various industries work and what
    data their companies rely upon that will point them in the right direction and
    possibly uncover some data business gems for their partners who do invest in data
    businesses.
