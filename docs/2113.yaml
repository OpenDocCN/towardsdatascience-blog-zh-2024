    who said “**AI is whatever hasn’t been done yet**.” The first example of Artificial
    Intelligence was the calculator, which was (and is) able to do very complex mathematical
    computations in a fraction of a second while it would take minutes or hours for
    a human being. Nonetheless, when we talk about AI today we don’t think about a
    calculator. We don’t think of it because it simply works incredibly well, and
    you take it for granted. The Google Search algorithm, which is in many ways much
    more complex than a calculator, is a form of AI that we use in our everyday lives
    but we don’t even think about it.
