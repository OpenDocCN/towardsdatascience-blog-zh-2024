    and then — bam! You are asked, *‘Have you ever thought about leading the team?’*
    Sounds tempting, right? But hold on — ***do you really know what you’re signing

    and helped scale our DS discipline from 20 to 50+. I have also seen fellow managers
    leave for new challenges. Both instances created a vacuum to fill: the need of
    a manager to lead a data science squad. Filling this void can be an amazing opportunity,
    **but I have also seen many colleagues fail to adjust to the transition**.'

    talks about the trade-offs. Most early managers walk in totally unprepared — that’s
    where the frustration starts.
