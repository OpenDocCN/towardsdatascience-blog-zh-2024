- en: During the last few years, the buzz around AI has been enormous, and the main
    trigger of all this is obviously the advent of GPT-based large language models.
    Interestingly, this approach itself is not new. LSTM (long short-term memory)
    neural networks were created in 1997, and a famous paper, “Attention is All You
    Need,” was published in 2017; both were the cornerstones of modern natural language
    processing. But only in 2020 will the results of GPT-3 be good enough, not only
    for academic papers but also for the real world.

- en: Nowadays, everyone can chat with GPT in a web browser, but probably less than
    1% of people actually know how it works. Smart and witty answers from the model
    can force people to think that they are talking with an *intelligent being*, but
    is it so? Well, the best way to figure it out is to see how it works. In this
    article, we will take a real GPT model from OpenAI, run it locally, and see step-by-step
    what is going on under the hood.

    and data science. I will illustrate my steps with Python, but deep Python understanding
    will not be required.
