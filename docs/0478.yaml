    is approaching, and you start to feel a headache coming on. You still have a few
    hours of work ahead, so you decide to take a pill. After a while, your headache
    is gone.

    between the two worlds.

    assess causality. Hence, many factors occur simultaneously and are confounded

    formalize these concepts. The most common approach is the potential outcomes framework,

    value one if a headache is present and zero otherwise. The subscript ‚Äúi‚Äù refers
    to the observed entity (e.g., a person, a lab rat, a city, etc.). Finally, the

    advertisement, a policy, etc.).

    without the treatment at the same time.

    Those animals have almost an identical genetic code, they live the same lab life,
    eat the same food, etc. Hence, when you do a controlled experiment with such animals
    you are very close to the parallel world situation working almost with clones.
    However, the external validity is weaker due to the homogeneity of the study subjects.
    Moreover, often in controlled experiments the whole environment is controlled
    and in some cases, it makes the situation a bit unrealistic and reduces the usefulness
    of the results.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    in the *British Medical Journal* (one of the most prestigious medical journals)*,*
    found no effect of using a parachute when jumping from an airplane on the ‚ÄúComposite
    of death or major traumatic injury‚Äù [(Yeh et al. (2018))](https://www.bmj.com/content/363/bmj.k5094).
    In this randomized experiment, the participants jumped from a small, stationary
    airplane on the ground. This absurd setup illustrates the issue that often arises
    in controlled experiments when the setup is unrealistic. The purpose of the paper
    is to raise awareness in medical research about the issue of external validity,
    which is a current and serious concern.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    designs. The idea is to observe a quasi-random allocation between groups in natural

    once we isolate or control for potential systematic differences.

- en: The rationale in this study is that individuals who consume alcohol are not
    usually comparable to those who don‚Äôt due to many other systematic differences
    (e.g. age, socio-economic statuts, risk of various diseases, etc.). However, by
    comparing individuals just below and just above the age of 21, one can argue they
    are very similar, assuming no other significant changes occur at that age. This
    approach allows for a clearer attribution of changes in mortality rates to alcohol
    consumption. This example, complete with data and code, is also included in the

- en: Following this guide will equip you with a solid theoretical foundation and
    a comprehensive toolbox for incorporating causal inference into your skillset.
    These concepts extend beyond measuring causal effects for your job; they enhance
    your critical thinking abilities. Abusive causal claims are widespread in the
    news, politics, by ‚Äòexperts‚Äô, managers, and others. Applying these concepts can
    reduce the risk of manipulation. This toolbox can also be valuable in everyday
    discussions with friends or during team meetings when making decisions or reflecting
    on observations.

    practice is essential. I encourage you to select a relevant question, find data,
    and use the tools provided in this guide to attempt to answer it. Then, include
    this project in your portfolio to showcase your new knowledge.
