- en: Graphs are data structures capable of representing a large amount of information.
    In addition to representing data samples individually as nodes, a graph also represents
    the relationship between the data, encapsulating more of the information stored
    in your dataset. When creating a graph, however, it is important to verify the
    quality of the graph, which is what I will discuss how you can do in this article.

- en: The motivation for this article is that I am creating graphs for a project I
    am working on. The graphs are later in my pipeline used to perform clustering
    as seen in the pipeline image below. To ensure the correctness of my graph, I
    want to have a test that can output the quality of each graph I create. When working
    on machine-learning projects, verifying your results and quality is vital for
    both saving time bug fixing and ensuring that your data pipeline is working correctly.
    The verification result can work as a sanity check, so you are sure the…
