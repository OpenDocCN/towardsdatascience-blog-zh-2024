    of every conversation, including business decision-making, data professionals
    must know how to best present the data they work with.

    we both were making decks for executives and in one breath we said “*Making data
    presentations for an executive audience is so different*”. The way we present
    our data and insights differs so much per the audience. From an extremely high-level
    overview to raising the smallest of a potential red flag, the same data can be
    narrated in so many different ways, the mere art of adapting when storytelling
    with data motivated me to write this blog.

    to create compelling presentations but what matters the most is the way that the
    data is presented!

    skill for data professionals today. Data alone cannot hold a great presentation.
    Storytelling with data is a highly valued skill…
