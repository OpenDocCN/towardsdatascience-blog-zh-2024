- en: There’s clearly some relationship between the values plotted in X and Y, but
    regular correlation coefficients like Pearson’s would return a score close to
    0\. However, the Predicted Power Score coupled to a proper model can identify
    the correlation. Figure drawn by the author.

- en: The Predictive Power Score (that I will just abbreviate as PPS hereafter) is
    a statistical metric used to measure the strength of a predictive relationship
    between two variables. But unlike traditional correlation measures, such as Pearson’s
    correlation coefficient *r*, which only work well for linear relationships between
    two continuous variables, the PPS is designed to handle a wider variety of relationships,
    including non-linear ones and categorical data.

- en: The PPS ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 means there’s just no predictive power (the
    variable is unable to predict the target) and 1 means perfect predictive power
    (the variable perfectly predicts the target).

- en: Notice that being always equal to or higher than zero, the PPS does not give
    information about the direction of the relationship as you can get with say Pearson’s
    correlation coefficient r which spans from -1 for anticorrelation to +1 for full
    positive correlation. The PPS only measures how well one variable can predict…
