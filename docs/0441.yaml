    of popularity. The attention of the Data Science community was rapidly captured
    by the release of GPT-3 in 2020\. After the appearance of GPT-2, almost nobody
    could even assume that nearly in a year there would appear a titanic version of
    GPT containing **175B of parameters**! This is by two orders of magnitude more,
    compared to its predecessor.'

    scenarios: code completion, article writing, content creation, virtual assistants,
    etc. While the quality of these tasks is not always perfect, the overall progress
    achieved by GPT-3 is absolutely astonishing!'

    useful ideas inspired by GPT-2 creators. Throughout the exploration, we will be
    referring to the [official GPT-3 paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf).
    It is worth noting that most of the GPT-3 settings including data collection,
    architecture choice and pre-training process are directly derived from GPT-2\.
    That is why most of the time we will be…
