    I was reminded that the points scores by event in the heptathlon always show a
    pattern: the first event, the 100 metres hurdles, usually sees large points numbers
    across the board, while the shot put, the third event, tends to return a couple
    of hundred fewer points per athlete.'

    **Table 1** shows clearly the pattern we’re talking about: the sprint events (200m
    and, in particular, 100m hurdles) provide around 200 points more, on average,
    than do the throwing events (javelin and shot put). This seems surprising, but
    is not necessarily of any importance, since all athletes are competing in all
    events, so it is only the points scored *relative to one another* that matter.
    The third column in the table above shows the interquartile range of points; that
    is, the difference between the 25th and 75th percentiles, or, the zone in which
    the ‘middle half’ of athletes lie. Here we see that the running events show the
    lowest spreads in points, while the high jump and javelin have the largest ranges.
    This suggests that the difference between performing quite poorly and quite well
    (relative to World-Championship-level competitors) is more important, in points
    terms, in some events that it is in others.'

    *a*, *b*, and *c*, to be defined. The values of the coefficients are not comparable
    individually between events, but the combination of the three creates a points
    curve for each event, as shown in **Figure 1**, below. The [World Athletics document
    on the scoring systems](https://worldathletics.org/download/download?filename=c651eeb3-0f9d-47c0-9314-a3bd001e0960.pdf&urlslug=IAAF+Scoring+Tables+for+Combined+Events)

    in each event: it is desired that a world-record performance in any event should
    yield the same number of points. They note that, in practice, this means that
    *‘the best scores set in each individual event will vary widely’,* but that it
    is more important that *‘the differences in the scores between different athletes
    in one event are roughly proportional to the differences in their performances’*.'

    in each event. The lines are almost straight, particularly within the green shaded
    score regions, which is where 80% of scores are contained, meaning that **the
    scoring system can, practically, be regarded as a linear system**. (There is a
    slight upward bend to some of the curves, particularly at the high-score end of
    the long jump and 800m, which means that exceptional performance is rewarded slightly
    more than would occur in a truly linear system, but these differences are small
    and are not the key point of this analysis.)

    from each event**. This is indicated by the vertical arrows, which show the points
    increase obtained by moving from a score at the 10th percentile (left edge of
    the green area) to a score at the 90th percentile (right edge of the green area).
    8 out of 10 performances occur in these ranges, and anything lower or higher is
    somewhat exceptional for that event. The size of this points range (the height
    of the arrow) is clearly larger in some events, most noticeably the javelin, than
    in others, most noticeably the 100m hurdles. This is almost the same information
    as seen in the interquartile range numbers earlier.

    athlete) **for shot put or javelin**, but the same heptathlete can attain **a
    speed of between 85% and 90% of the world record** (converted from time) **in
    the 100m hurdles and the 200m**.'

    it seems fair to assume is that an event in which performances are far from the
    world record has more potential for improvements than an event in which performances
    are already close to their ultimate limit. To put this another way, it seems that
    most heptathletes are able to run fairly well compared to the specialists in those
    events (including the 800m), but in the javelin, their performances generally
    show relatively large deficiencies compared to what is possible in the event.
    Importantly though, as the wider score spread for javelin shows, ***some* heptathletes
    can throw the javelin fairly well.**

- en: To make this more clear, next, I use the distributions of scores in each event
    to measure the points gain that would result from an athlete improving her performance
    in the event from the 50th percentile (better than half of her competitors) to
    the 60th percentile (better than 6 in 10 competitors). The intention with this
    metric is that this improvement might be equally difficult, or equally achievable,
    in each event, as it is measured by what other heptathletes have achieved. When
    finding the percentile levels, to avoid problems with the discrete nature of scores
    in the high jump (only jumps every 3 cm are possible), the raw scores from each
    event are modelled as distributions (normal in most cases, and log-normal in the
    cases of high jump, 100m hurdles, and 800m), and the percentiles computed from
    these.

    to one’s peers earns more points in the field events than in the running events**.
    A 10% improvement relative to the competition in the javelin would be the most
    beneficial performance gain to make, earning the heptathlete 28 points. Later
    we will discuss whether or not it is truly as easy to make a 10% throwing improvement
    as it is to improve scores by 10% in the track events.

    In **Table 2**, we find that, again, the javelin shows the biggest interquartile
    range for points scored, followed by the 1500m (which sits much higher up the
    list than the women’s most similar event, the 800m) and the pole vault. Conversely,
    the sprint events (100m, 110m hurdles, and 400m) show smaller points spreads.
    The difference in spreads between the top and bottom events is not quite as severe
    as it is in the heptathlon.

    and some way behind, the discus and 1500m. Again, the sprint hurdles shows a small
    points spread: the worst hurdlers are not penalised much in comparison to the
    best hurdlers.'

- en: The 1500m sits lowest in points terms of any event, with a 10th percentile performance
    worth only around 600 points. This is a result of the steepness of the blue line,
    which dictates how much the decathlete is penalised for each additional second
    that they are away from the world record. The blue line does not have to look
    like this, but it does as a result of the choice of the coefficients *a, b,* and
    *c.* On the plus side, the steepness of the line creates a relatively large points
    difference between different scores in the 1500m, as seen below.

    to the rest of the field in javelin, pole vault, or middle distance running should
    provide the biggest points gain per unit of improvement, the benefit of this is
    undercut by a possible decrease in performance in other events. On the other hand,
    **improving skill in one of the sprint-based events tends to create gains in similar
    events at the same time**, perhaps making this a more efficient approach to the
    competitions overall.

    with position** — that is, the event in which the athlete’s score most dictates
    where they finish in the overall competition — **is found in the long jump in
    both heptathlon and decathlon,** followed by hurdles and high jump in heptathlon,
    and by hurdles and 400m in decathlon. The importance of long jump is likely due
    to its ‘centrality’ in the competitions: its relatively high correlations with
    several other events. Conversely, **performance in the 1500m is the least correlated
    with finish position in decathlon**. This is probably because the best 1500m runners
    tend not to hold advantages in other events too, so often end up lower in the
    overall standings. **The decathlon is more often won by a strong sprinter**, because

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Insights on how best to approach the heptathlon and decathlon turned out different
    from how I expected at the start of the analysis. Although it seems that effort
    to improve one’s score in the javelin is the most efficient way to increase total
    points, the athletes that perform best overall do not tend to do particularly
    well in javelin. This is likely because the skills required for javelin, and to
    a lesser extent, pole vault, discus, and high jump, do not transfer well to other
    events, so the benefit of the effort is limited to a points return in that event
    only.

    which it is perhaps possible, though difficult, for the athlete to ‘unlock’ big
    gains in performance through small adjustments in technique, whereas some of the
    other events are more controlled by strength or fitness, in which only incremental
    gains are feasible. Probably the difficulty in making those technical improvements,
    combined with the shared benefits of general fitness improvements, tips the balance
    in favour of improving scores in the sprint-related events.

    lines in Figures 1 and 3 is anchored at one point by the world record, but the
    gradient of the line appears to be a choice that could have been made differently.
    The bigger the gradient, the more emphasis is put on the difference in score between
    the best and worst athletes in that event. In fact, **the large gradients for
    the javelin and other events may be necessary to balance these more isolated events
    against the shared benefits of improvements in the sprint events**. If the points
    bars of Figures 2 and 4 were equal across all events, there would be less incentive
    to focus effort on the technical events in preference to the more intercorrelated
    sprint events.

- en: There is no likelihood of the multi-event scoring systems changing in the near
    future. I would suggest that **the right-most columns of Figures 5 and 6 show
    that the systems currently work well**, as there are no events that are completely
    uncorrelated with finish position (which would mean that performance in those
    events didn’t matter to the overall result). If there were to be changes to the
    system, it might be a good idea to target more even correlations in this column,
    which would mean increasing the points gradient in the 800m and 1500m, in particular,
    to increase the benefit of performing well in these events, at the expense of
    the long jump and hurdles, which currently have a bigger bearing on the final
    standings.
