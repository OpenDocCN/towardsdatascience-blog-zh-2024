    someone dropped a tip about adding "**before:2023**" to Google searches to eliminate
    a lot of AI-generated SEO content. Honestly, I haven't used it, but you get the
    gist, right? Today, the internet is swamped with so much AI-generated content

    Amazon employed a technique known as “**search seeding**” to ensure that products
