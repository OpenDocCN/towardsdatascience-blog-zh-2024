- en: What neighborhood do you live in? What drug were you prescribed? Why did you
    cancel your streaming subscription? These days, there’s a code for that, stored
    in databases by whatever governments agencies, businesses, etc. you interact with.
    If you work in data, you probably encounter many such codes. When they can take
    many possible values, such codes are called “**high cardinality categorical features**”.

    1 depicts such a structure, the North American Industry Classification System
    (NAICS), which is used by the US government to classify businesses [1].

- en: '**Figure 1:** Illustration of the hierarchical structure of [North American
    Industry Classification System](https://www.census.gov/naics/) (NAICS) codes [1],
    which categorize businesses by area of activity. There are many specific codes
    (at the bottom of the “pyramid”), which are grouped into more general classes
    (the upper levels). The example of a bagel shop is shown. Image by author.'

- en: Many code sets can be represented as a hierarchy. For example, US geographic
    regions can be divided into smaller areas with many code values (zip codes), or
    very large ones with few ([US Census regions](https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf),
    e.g. “West”). Or, the American Medical Association defines ~475 [areas of provider
    specialization](https://www.nucc.org/images/stories/PDF/taxonomy_24_0.pdf), which
    are rolled up into classifications, groupings, and sections.
