    tools as the industry evolves. With a recent boom in Artificial Intelligence,
    there is a great deal of focus on emerging technology like [chatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt)
    as a large-scale LLM-powered data product, Github [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
    to assist programmers in writing code with on-the-fly-suggestions, and of course
    many more.

    are heavily impacted by a phrase we all know and love: “Garbage in, garbage out”.
    This concept revolves around the idea that solid data pipelines are a crux for
    good data science. While many understand this to be true, the reality is that
    data-centric organizations don’t often supplement their data science teams with
    dedicated, or sometimes any, data engineering support.'
