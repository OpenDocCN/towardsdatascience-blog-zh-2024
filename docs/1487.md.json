["```py\n[Problem Distiller]:\nAs a highly professional and intelligent expert in information distillation, you excel at\nextracting essential information to solve problems from user input queries. You adeptly\ntransform this extracted information into a suitable format based on the respective type of the\nissue.\nPlease categorize and extract the crucial information required to solve the problem from the\nuserâ€™s input query, the distilled information should include.\n1\\. Key information:\nValues and information of key variables extracted from user input, which will be handed over\nto the respective expert for task resolution, ensuring all essential information required to solve\nthe problem is provided.\n2\\. Restrictions:\nThe objective of the problem and corresponding constraints.\n3\\. Distilled task:\nExtend the problem based on 1 and 2, summarize a meta problem that can address the user\nquery and handle more input and output variations. Incorporate the real-world scenario of the\nextended problem along with the types of key variables and information constraints from the\noriginal problem to restrict the key variables in the extended problem. After that, use the user\nquery input key information as input to solve the problem as an example.\n```", "```py\n{\"input\": \"<start> life plan and families to for social hospital workers outside with patients work the <end>\", \n\"target\": \"<start> social workers work with patients and families to plan for life outside the hospital <end>\"}\n{\"input\": \"<start> yield plant refers dry total to production biological matter <end>\", \n\"target\": \"<start> biological yield refers to total plant dry matter production <end>\"}\n{\"input\": \"<start> the bloodstream into alcohol from directly stomach goes the <end>\", \n\"target\": \"<start> alcohol goes directly from the stomach into the bloodstream <end>\"}\n```", "```py\nReorder a list of words to make them semantically meaningful, \nfor example \"Sam name is my\" -> \"my name is Sam\". \nPlease provide only the reordered sentence without any explanations. \nStart the ordered sentence with <start> and end it with <end>\n```", "```py\nUser prompt:\nReorder a list of words to make them semantically meaningful, for example \"Sam name is my\" -> \"my name is Sam\".
