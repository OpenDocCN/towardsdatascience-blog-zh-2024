    is one of the most promising applications for large language models (LLMs).

    Gemini Experimental 1121, which currently leads the LMArena Leaderboard, to tackle
    the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge.

    that runs from December 1st to December 25th, offering daily programming puzzles
    similar to an advent calendar. Each day, a new two-part puzzle is released where
    coders can test their coding and problem-solving skills. Itâ€™s a fun way for developers
    of all levels to practice coding.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both parts of the daily challenge revolve around a similar problem and use the
    same input data. The idea is to write a Python program that will process the input
    data and produce a solution (typically a number). Once we run the code and the
    model calculated the solution, we can take it and paste it into the website, which
    then will tell us if the solution was correct. If so, the second part will be
    unlocked with the a similar procedure.

    problem statement and plug it into an LLM of our choice, let it produce the code,
    run the code, and take the solution that was produced and paste it into the website
    to see if the LLM was successful.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With this project I want to explore how capable state-of-the-art LLMs are currently
    at solving coding challenges. I have the hypothesis that Gemini (and other LLMs)
    have gotten good enough to solve most of these challenges. This does, of course,
    not mean that they are fit (yet) to solve real software challenges that are much
    more complex.
