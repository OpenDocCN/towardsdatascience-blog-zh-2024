    When it first appeared? I do! It was in **1974**. I wasn’t even born yet, and
    people were already writing in SQL. Today, nearly 50 years later, it’s younger
    than ever.'

    some point, you will likely work with SQL: whether it’s to access a database,
    prepare a pipeline, or load data.'

    engineering**, it doesn’t matter. SQL will probably be part of your job at some
    point. Anyone who works with data will have to use SQL in some project.

    on **data engineering**. I’ll present the main commands and then move on to more
    complex topics, demonstrating various **hands-on activities**.

    There’s no escaping it, ok? You’ve got to add it to your **toolbox**. The more
    tools you know, the more problems you’ll be able to solve.
