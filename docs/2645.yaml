- en: Have you noticed some of the “distance from” maps on social media? I just saw
    one by [Todd Jones](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/101mbsr/distance_to_the_nearest_national_park_oc/)
    that shows how far you are from a national park at any location in the Lower 48
    States.

- en: These proximity maps are fun and useful. If you're a survivalist, you might
    want to relocate as far as possible from a potential nuclear missile target; if
    you’re an avid fisherman, you might want to stick close to a [Bass Pro Shop](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/102buf3/distance_to_the_nearest_bass_pro_shops_oc/#lightbox).

    college football. Despite this, he did very well in our weekly betting pool. One
    of his secrets was to bet against any team that had to travel more than 300 miles
    to play, assuming the competing teams were on par, or the home team was favored.

    from” maps for college football teams in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). We’ll
    find which team has to make the longest trips, on average, to play other teams,
    and which has the shortest trips. We’ll then contour up these distances on a map
    of the southeastern US. In addition, we’ll look at how to grid and contour other
    continuous data, like temperatures.
