    how both KernelSHAP and TreeSHAP can be used to explain its output.

- en: '[Isolation Forest](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/isolation-forest) has
    become a staple in anomaly detection systems [1]. Its advantage is being able
    to find complex anomalies in large datasets with many features. However, when
    it comes to explaining those anomalies, this advantage quickly becomes a weakness.'

- en: To take action on an anomaly we often have to understand the reasons for it
    being classified as one. This insight is particularly valuable in real-world applications,
    such as fraud detection, where knowing the reason behind an anomaly is often as
    important as detecting it.

    complex model structure. To uncover them, we turn to SHAP.

    that although this is an unsupervised model we can still use SHAP to explain its
    anomaly scores. That is to understand:'
