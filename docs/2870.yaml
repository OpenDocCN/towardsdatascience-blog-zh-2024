- en: Data science is undoubtedly one of the most fascinating fields today. Following
    significant breakthroughs in machine learning about a decade ago, data science
    has surged in popularity within the tech community. Each year, we witness increasingly
    powerful tools that once seemed unimaginable. Innovations such as the *Transformer
    architecture*, *ChatGPT*, the *Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG*) framework,
    and state-of-the-art *computer vision models* — including *GANs* — have had a
    profound impact on our world.
