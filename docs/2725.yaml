- en: In just 91 lines of C++ code, I perfectly predicted every United States presidential
    election since 1916\. That’s 28 straight elections, counting the most recent one
    in 2024.

- en: The crazy part is I didn’t rely on any complicated polling data trends, voter
    sentiment, or policy analysis to make these predictions. I just used basic principles
    of probability.

- en: Alright, I’ll admit I cheated a little. But arguably not much more than the
    political pundits that claim to have predicted every election since, say, 1980.

- en: Every election cycle, you see stories on the news of someone who has correctly
    predicted every election in however many years. Most recently, I saw stories about
    [Allan Lichtman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Lichtman), who correctly
    predicted most of the 11 elections from 1984 through 2020\. His system for predicting
    elections is called the “13 Keys”, and consists of 13 true/false questions to
    predict the winner of the election.[1]

    election pundits who claim to have sophisticated election prediction systems?
