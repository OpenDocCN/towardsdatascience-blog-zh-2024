- en: Computer vision can be an important part of ML apps of different scales, from
    $20,000 Tesla Bots or self-driving cars to smart doorbells and vacuum cleaners.
    It is also a challenging task because, compared to a cloud infrastructure, on
    “real” edge devices, the hardware specs are often much more constrained.

- en: YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a popular object detection library; its first version
    was made in 2015\. YOLO is particularly interesting for embedded devices because
    it can run almost anywhere; there are not only Python but also C++ (ONNX and OpenVINO)
    and Rust versions available. A year ago, I [tested YOLO v8](/yolo-object-detection-on-the-raspberry-pi-6de3629256fa)
    on a Raspberry Pi 4\. Nowadays, many things have changed — a new Raspberry Pi
    5 became available, and a newer YOLO v10 was released. So I expect a new model
    on new hardware to work faster and more precisely.

    a Raspberry Pi can run it on a Windows, Linux, or OS X computer as well.
