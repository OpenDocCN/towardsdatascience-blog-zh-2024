- en: Rahul decides to measure the “pulse” of customers buying from his online store.
    He wanted to know how they are feeling, what is going well, and what can be improved
    for user experience. Because he has learnt about mathematics and he knows the
    numbers game, he decides to have a survey with 200 of his 2500 customers. Rahul
    uses Simple Random Sampling and gets 200 unique customer IDs. He sends them an
    online survey, and receives the results. According to the survey, the biggest
    impediment with the customers was lack of payment options while checking out.
    Rahul contacts a few vendors, and invests in rolling out a few more payment options.
    Unfortunately, the results after six months showed that there was no significant
    increase in the revenue. His analysis fails, and he wonders if the resources were
    spent in the right place.

    Some spend more, some spend less, and some spend a lot. Don’t be like Rahul. Be
    like Sheila, and learn how you can use PPS Sampling — an approach that ensures
    that your most important (profitable) customers never get overlooked — for reasonable
    and robust statistical analysis.

- en: Before I discuss PPS Sampling, I will briefly mention what sampling is. Sampling
    is a statistical technique which allows us to take a portion of our population,
    and use this portion of our population to measure some characteristics of the
    population. For example, taking a sample of blood to measure if we have an infectious
    disease, taking a sample of rice pudding to check if sugar is enough, and taking
    a sample of customers to measure the general pulse of customers. Because we cannot
    afford measuring each and every single unit of the entire population, it is best
    to take a sample and then infer the population characteristics. This suffices
    for a definition here. If you need more information about sampling, the Internet
    has a lot of resources.

- en: Probability Proportional to Size (PPS) Sampling is a sampling technique, where
    the probability of selection of a unit in the sample is dependent upon the size
    of a defined variable or an auxiliary variable.

- en: Let me explain with the help of an example. Suppose you have an online store,
    and there are 1000 people who are your customers. Some customers spend a lot of
    money and bring a lot of revenue to your organization. These are very important
    customers. You need to ensure that your organization serve the interests of these
    customers in the best way possible.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you want to understand the mood of these customers, you would prefer a situation
    where your sample has a higher representation of these customers. This is exactly
    what PPS allows you to do. If you use PPS Sampling, the probability of selecting
    the highest revenue generating customers is also high. This makes sense. The revenue
    in this case is the auxiliary or dependency variable.

- en: Simple Random Sampling is great. No denial of that fact, but it’s not the only
    tool that you have in your arsenal. SRS works best for the situations where your
    *population is homogenous*. Unfortunately for many practical business applications,
    the audience or population is not homogenous. If you do an analysis with wrong
    assumption, you will get the wrong inferences. SRS Sampling gives the same probability
    of selection to each unit of the population which is different from PPS Sampling.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As the title of this article says, you cannot afford not knowing PPS Sampling.
    Here are five reasons why.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Better Representativeness** — By prioritizing the units that have a higher
    impact on your variable of interest (revenue), you are ensuring that the sample
    has a better representativeness. This contrasts with SRS which assumes that a
    customer spending 100 USD a month is equal to the customer spending 1000 USD a
    month. Nein, no, nahin, that is not the case.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Focus on High-Impact Units** — According to the Pareto principle, 80% of
    your revenue is generated by 20% of the customers. You need to ensure you do not
    mess up with these 20% of the customers. By ensuring a sample having a higher
    say for these 20% customers, you will avoid yourself and them any unseen surprises.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Resource Efficiency** — There is a thumb’s rule in statistics which says
    that on an average if you have a sample of 30, you can get close to the estimated
    population parameters. Note that this is only a thumb rule. PPS Sampling allows
    you to use the resources you have in designing, distributing, and analyzing interventions
    are used judiciously.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Improved Accuracy** — Because we are putting more weight on the units that
    have a larger impact on our variable of interest, we are more accurate with our
    analysis. This may not be possible with just SRS. The sample estimates which you
    get from PPS Sampling are weighted for the units that have a higher impact. In
    simple words, you are working for those who pay the most.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Better Decision-Making** — When you use PPS sampling, you’re making decisions
    based on data that actually matters. If you only sample customers randomly, you
    might end up with feedback or insights from people whose opinions have little
    influence on your revenue. With PPS, you’re zeroing in on the important customers.
    It’s like asking the right people the right questions instead of just anyone in
    the crowd.'

- en: Slightly more than six years ago, I wrote [this article](https://chaayushmalik.medium.com/pps-sampling-in-python-b5d5d4a8bdf7)
    on Medium which is one of my most-read articles, and is shown on the first page
    when you search for Probability Proportional to Size Sampling (PPS Sampling, from
    now onwards). The article shows how one can use PPS Sampling for representative
    sampling using Python. A lot of water has flown under the bridge since then, and
    I now I have much more experience in causal inference, and my Python skills have
    improved considerably too. The code linked above used systematic PPS Sampling,
    whereas the new code uses random PPS Sampling.

    that there will be no cons of PPS Sampling. Well, it has some. Here are they.

- en: PPS Sampling is complex to understand so it may not always have a buy-in from
    the management of an organization. In that case, it is the data scientist’s job
    to ensure that the benefits are explained in the right manner.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: PPS Sampling requires that there is a dependency variable. For example, in our
    case we chose revenue as a variable upon which we select our units. If you are
    in agriculture industry, this could be the land size for measuring yield of a
    cropping season.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: PPS Sampling is perceived to be biased against the units having a lower impact.
    Well, it is not biased and the smaller units also have a chance of getting selected,
    but the probability is lower for them.

    more resource-efficient than SRS Sampling, and how you can implement it using
    Python. I am curious to hear more examples from your work to see how you implement
    PPS at your work.
