    amount of time in your career going through various phases of lowered confidence
    levels in creating effective data presentations. We all get trained extensively
    in college, grad schools and boot camps on the various steps required to perform
    Data mining and gather insights from complex datasets. By the book, we know that
    you start with the Data Cleaning and preparation, then move on Data exploration
    and eventually to mining and finding patterns. But often times when we’re thrown
    into the real world with very real business problems we end up spending hours
    doubting our methodologies and sometimes the entire premise. Or even worse, get
    stuck in hours and hours of Analysis Paralysis. I’m sharing a simple framework
    to tackle this state of mind.

    need to be included in your presentation audience. The Data literacy levels of
    your audience also dictates the language you use in your presentations. More importantly,
    you’d want to make sure that this group is willing to listen to your recommendations,
    so your data work can create the organization level impact it deserves.

    ready before you venture out looking for them in your organization’s data sphere.
    This will also keep you focused on the problem statement without getting distracted
    by other interesting data points you discover. If something interesting comes

    them for the appendix. Personally, I found this mindset shift game changing. Doing

    the question is, the Data person spends a substantial amount of time in Data prep
    and exploration, before narrowing down the answer to a specific set of data points.
    It might have taken you several days or weeks to get a clean dataset prepared,
    your exploration steps may have involved several failed hypotheses and assumptions
    before landing on the answer. New and more interesting correlations may have emerged,
    but resist the urge to include it in your presentation if it doesn’t add any useful
    details to the data story you’re presenting.

    As you get more opportunities to present your data work, don’t forget to document
    what worked and what did not. Soon enough, you’ll have a little inventory of types
    of visualizations, analyses and recommendations to include based on your audience
    and stakeholder group. The bigger this list gets, the more impactful your data
    presentations will become.

    a rotation track completely unrelated to data science. This was back in 2012,

    a little section on One Note to document all instances where my analyses were
    well received and the ones where I had to spend a lot of time on back and forth

    slides talking about how great that is and dedicated time to analyze it. But ultimately,
    since it did not have a direct tie to the company’s priorities for that quarter,
    none of my audience were able to share my level of enthusiasm. I now want to wrap
