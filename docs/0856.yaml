    and teams want to start or increase leveraging it. Because of that, many job positions
    are appearing or gaining importance in the market. A good example is the figure
    of Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence Product Manager.

    Product Manager role over two years ago. During this time, I have been able to
    see a constant increase in job offers related to this position, blog posts and
    talks discussing it, and many people considering a transition or gaining interest
    in it. I have also been able to confirm my passion for this role and how much
    I enjoy my day-to-day work, responsibilities, and value I can bring to the team
    and company.

    AI. Although many product teams are becoming relatively autonomous using AI thanks
    to plug-in solutions and GenAI APIs, I will focus on the role of AI / ML PMs working
    in core ML teams. These teams are usually formed by Data Scientists, Machine Learning
    Engineers, and Research Scientists, and together with other roles are involved
    in solutions where GenAI through an API might not be enough (traditional ML use
    cases, need of LLMs fine tuning, specific in-house use cases, ML as a service
    products…). For an illustrative example of such a team, you can check one of my
    previous posts *“Working in a multidisciplinary Machine Learning team to bring
    value to our users”.*

    and user pain to solve and not so much with the specific solution, and thinking
    about where we can bring more value to our users instead of where to apply this
    cool new AI model. I have found it key to have a clear understanding of OKRs ([Objective
    Key Results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectives_and_key_results)) and to
    care about the final impact of the initiatives (delivering outcomes instead of
    outputs).

    AI** awareness becomes paramount. Risks related to not taking this into account
    include ethical dilemmas, company reputation, and legal issues (e.g. specific

    analytical thinking, being curious about data, understanding where data is stored,
    how to access it, importance of historical data… On top of that it is also important
    to kow how to measure impact, the relationship with business metrics and OKRs,

    it. In deeplearning.ai, you can find a great course on MLOPs ([Machine Learning

    my short and mid term desires and expectations with managers and colleagues. Through
    this, I was able to transition into a PM role in the same company where I was
    working as a Data Scientist. This made the transition much easier: I already knew
    the business, product, tech, ways of working, colleagues… I also looked for mentors
    and colleagues within the company to whom I could ask questions, learn specific
    topics from and even practice for the PM interviews.'

    try, experiment, and decide to go back to your previous role. Or maybe, who knows,
    you end up loving being an ML / AI PM just like I do!
