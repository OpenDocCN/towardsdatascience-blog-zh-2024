    —all of these and more have been mentioned recently in news and comments that
    look like the harbinger of a serious setback for Generative AI. Some have even
    called for the demise of the AI “[bubble](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/13/from-boom-to-burst-the-ai-bubble-is-only-heading-in-one-direction),”

    be (have been?) mitigated with the help of the good old symbolic reasoning.

    how much is the cubic root of 123,456.78, getting 49.3989 as the answer. Then
    I asked ChatGPT to multiply 49.3989 by itself two times, supposedly getting back
    to my 123,456.78 number, and –no kidding– ChatGPT came with 123,456.78 as a result,
    supposedly verifying the correctness of its operation. I could have believed it,
    but just to be sure, I made the operation with a calculator and multiplying 49.3989
    by itself two times got 120,545.73, which is almost 3,000 units away from the
    intended result. That means, of course, that the first operation (the cubic root)
    was wrong in the…
