    the coming weeks and months, and provide actionable advice from authors who are
    deeply embedded in a wide cross-section of industry and academic roles. From mastering
    the ins and outs of data infrastructure to expanding one’s storytelling skills,
    let’s take a close look at some of those peripheral—but still crucial—areas of
    potential growth.

    scientists possess a unique perspective that allows them to come up with innovative
    business ideas of their own — ideas that are novel, strategic, or differentiating
    and are unlikely to come from anyone but a data scientist.” [Eric Colson](https://medium.com/u/6292f6223477?source=post_page---user_mention--3112f3845b50--------------------------------)
    expands on a thought-provoking premise, namely that companies are under-utilizing
    data scientists by focusing too much on their technical skills, at the expense
    of their creativity and outside-the-box thinking.'

    anyone on the data science management path—whether in its early stages or deeper
    into your career—it can sometimes feel like leadership skills are expected to
    grow organically with nothing more than the passage of time. While that might

    makes clear, the process of becoming a standout job applicant and identifying
