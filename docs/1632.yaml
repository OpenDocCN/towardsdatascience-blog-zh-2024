    and metal business. He wanted to know if it was possible to create something that
    would help him solve the problem of minimising waste when cutting steel beams.
    Sounds like a problem for linear programming!

- en: When I started out, there was not a huge amount of beginners articles on how
    to use linear programming in R that made sense for somebody not that versed in
    math. Linear programming with R was also an area where ChatGPT did not shine in
    early 2023, so I found myself wishing for a guide.

    to someone.

    linear programming in R, have a look at [**part I**](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/optimize-production-with-r-part-i-25497d29e06e)**.**

- en: If you read the theory behind linear programming, or linear optimisation, you
    end up with a lot of math. This can be off-putting if you don’t have a math background
    (I don’t). For me, it’s mostly because I never took enough math classes to understand
    a lot of the symbols. Initially, this made understanding the tutorials surrounding
    linear programming harder than it should have been. However, you don’t need to
    understand the math behind the theory to apply the principles of code in this
    article.
