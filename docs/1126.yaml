- en: Hansen (1982) pioneered the introduction of the generalized method of moments
    (GMM), making notable contributions to empirical research in finance, particularly
    in asset pricing. The creation of the model was motivated by the need to estimate
    parameters in economic models while adhering to the theoretical constraints implicit
    in the model. For example, if the economic model states that two things should
    be independent, the GMM will try to find a solution in which the average of their
    product is zero. Therefore, understanding GMM can be a powerful alternative for
    those who need a model in which theoretical conditions are extremely important,
    but which conventional models cannot satisfy due to the nature of the data.

    address endogeneity and other issues in regression analysis. The basic concept
    of the GMM estimator involves minimizing a criterion function by choosing parameters
    that make the sample moments of the data as close as possible to the population
    moments. The equation for the Basic GMM Estimator can be expressed as follows:'

- en: The GMM estimator aims to find the parameter vector θ that minimizes this criterion
    function, thereby ensuring that the sample moments of the data align as closely
    as possible with the population moments. By optimizing this criterion function,
    the GMM estimator provides consistent estimates of the parameters in econometric
    models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Being consistent means that as the sample size approaches infinity, the estimator
    converges in probability to the true parameter value (asymptotically normal).
    This property is crucial for ensuring that the estimator provides reliable estimates
    as the amount of data increases. Even in the presence of omitted variables, as
    long as the moment conditions are valid and instruments are correctly specified,
    GMM can provide consistent estimators. However, the omission of relevant variables
    can impact the efficiency and interpretation of the estimated parameters.

- en: To be efficient, GMM utilizes Generalized Least Squares (GLS) on Z-moments to
    improve the precision and efficiency of parameter estimates in econometric models.
    GLS addresses heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation by weighting observations
    based on their variance. In GMM, Z-moments are projected into the column space
    of instrumental variables, similar to a GLS approach. This minimizes variance
    and enhances parameter estimate precision by focusing on Z-moments and applying
    GLS techniques.

    model include: linearity in the relationship between variables, absence of perfect
    multicollinearity, zero mean error, homoscedasticity (constant variance of errors),
    non-autocorrelation of errors and normality of errors. Therefore, OLS is an unbiased,
    consistent and efficient estimator. Furthermore, it have relatively lower computational
    complexity.'

    of contexts such as models with measurement errors, endogenous variables, heteroscedasticity,
    and autocorrelation. It makes no assumptions about the distribution of errors
    and is applicable to nonlinear models. GMM stands out in cases where we have omitted
    important variables, multiple moment conditions, nonlinear models, and datasets
    with heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation.

    their approaches to handling data assumptions. GMM constructs estimators using
    data and population moment conditions, providing flexibility and adaptability
    to models with fewer assumptions, particularly advantageous when strong assumptions
    about data distribution may not hold.

    on specific assumptions about data distribution. While MLE performs optimally
    when the assumed distribution closely aligns with the true data-generating process,
    GMM accommodates various distributions, proving valuable in scenarios where data
    may not conform to a single specific distribution.

    library to estimate a GMM model with the IVGMM function. In this model, consumption
    serves as the dependent variable, while age and gender (represented as a dummy
    variable for male) are considered exogenous variables. Additionally, we assume
    that income is an endogenous variable, while the number of children and education
    level are instrumental variables.

    by providing a source of exogenous variation that is correlated with the endogenous
    regressors but uncorrelated with the error term. The IVGMM function is specifically
    designed for estimating models in which instrumental variables are used within
    the framework of GMM.

    exogenous variables (age and gender) along with instrumental variables (number

- en: In conclusion, the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) is seen as a powerful
    and versatile technique in both econometric and statistical applications, giving
    it a certain advantage over other methods in some cases. In contrast to the traditional
    OLS and MLE methods, this method allows for a wider range of model specifications
    and data structures, as it is less restricted in the assumptions that are required
    to be satisfied.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In cases of endogeneity, measurement errors, momentum constraints, GMM is especially
    advantageous. Furthermore, the model performs better in the presence of non-linearities
    and issues of heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation in the data. GMM utilizes
    moment conditions and instrumental variables that provide consistent and efficient
    parameter estimates and is therefore a great alternative of choice for empirical
    researchers where theoretical conditions are critically important and common methods
    are not applicable due to violated assumptions or complex data structures.

    range of empirical settings, allowing researchers to adequately handle complex
    modeling tasks and provide correct estimates of model parameters.
