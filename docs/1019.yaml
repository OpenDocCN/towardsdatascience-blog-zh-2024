- en: Named Entity Disambiguation (NED) is an essential task in Natural Language Processing
    (NLP) for resolving ambiguous mentions of named entities to their corresponding
    unambiguous entities in a reference knowledge base.

- en: The key idea of NED is to map a continuous span of text, such as "Type 2 diabetes",
    to a ground-truth entity, such as the ["Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (CUI C0011860)"](https://ncim-stage.nci.nih.gov/ncimbrowser/ConceptReport.jsp?dictionary=NCI+Metathesaurus&code=C0011860)
    located in a medical knowledge base such as the "Unified Medical Language System"
    (UMLS). The role of NED is particularly relevant in critical domains, including
    biomedical ones, because detecting precise information with high accuracy is fundamental
    to making the right decisions at the appropriate time.

- en: Large Language Models (LLMs) are machine learning models capable of learning
    patterns and relationships from a vast amount of textual data and, based on this
    accumulated and compressed knowledge, they are able to generate human language
    text. However, because of their inherent limitations, LLMs are ineffective in
    tasks demanding precise and detailed human language comprehension, such as disambiguating
    named entities. Moreover, some of their…
