    they focus solely on point estimates — typically the mean or the mode — rather
    than attempting to capture the full range of possibilities. This is not just a
    matter of how the predictions are used; this limitation is inherent in the design
    of many conventional machine learning algorithms. Random forests, generalized
    linear models (GLM), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and gradient boosting
    machines, among others, are all designed to predict the expected value (mean)
    of a distribution when used for regression tasks. In classification problems,
    while logistic regression and other GLMs naturally attempt to estimate probabilities
    of class membership, tree-based methods like random forests and gradient boosting
    produce raw scores that would require additional calibration steps (like isotonic
    regression or Platt scaling) to be transformed into meaningful probabilities.
    Yet in practice, this calibration is rarely performed, and even when uncertainty
    information is available (i.e., the probabilities), it is typically discarded
    in favor of the single most likely class, i.e., the mode.'

    wrong conclusions, much like our lukewarm coffee predictor. A stark example is
    the Gaussian copula formula used to price collateralized debt obligations (CDOs)
    before the 2008 financial crisis. By reducing the complex relationships between
    mortgage defaults to a single correlation number, among other issues, this model
    catastrophically underestimated the possibility of simultaneous defaults (MacKenzie
    & Spears, 2014). This systematic underestimation of extreme risks is so pervasive
    that some investment funds, like Universa Investments advised by Nassim Taleb,
    incorporate strategies to capitalize on it. They recognize that markets consistently
    undervalue the probability and impact of extreme events (Patterson, 2023). When
    we reduce a complex distribution of possible outcomes to a single number, we lose
    critical information about uncertainty, risk, and potential extreme events that
    could drastically impact decision-making.

    partly by properly modeling these complex distributions. When asked about Renaissance
    Technologies’ approach — whose Medallion fund purportedly achieved returns of
    66% annually before fees from 1988 to 2018 (Zuckerman, 2019) — founder Jim Simons
    emphasized that they carefully consider that market risk “is typically not a normal
    distribution, the tails of a distribution are heavier and the inside is not as
    heavy” (Simons, 2013, 47:41), highlighting the critical importance of looking

    The reasons may be both practical and cultural. Predicting distributions is technically
    more challenging than predicting single values, requiring more sophisticated models
    and greater computational resources. But more fundamentally, most business processes
    and tools are simply not designed to handle distributional thinking. You cannot
    put a probability distribution in a spreadsheet cell, and many decision-making
    frameworks demand concrete numbers rather than ranges of possibilities. Moreover,
    as Kahneman (2011) notes in his analysis of human decision-making, we are naturally
    inclined to think in terms of specific scenarios rather than statistical distributions
    — our intuitive thinking prefers simple, concrete answers over probabilistic ones.

    sell their two-room flat to fund the acquisition of a four-room property. Given
    the operational and maintenance costs, and the capacity of their newly acquired
    state-of-the-art Roomba with all options, they reckoned that 90m² is the perfect
    surface area for them. They want to estimate how much they need to save/borrow
    to complement the proceeds from the sale. Homer followed a MOOC on machine learning
    just before graduating in advanced French literature last year, and immediately

    firm that was heavily investing in expanding (admittedly from scratch, really)

    (as opposed to, e.g., explanatory modeling), the primary concern with OLS is not
    necessarily the normality (and homoscedasticity) of errors but the potential for
    extreme values in the long tail to disproportionately influence the model — OLS
    minimizes squared errors, making it sensitive to extreme observations, particularly
    those that deviate significantly from the Gaussian distribution assumed for the
    errors.

    specifying a distribution for the response variable (from the exponential family)
    and using a “link function” to connect the linear predictor to the mean of that
    distribution. While linear models assume normally distributed errors and estimate
    the expected response E(Y) directly through a linear predictor, GLMs allow for
    different response distributions and transform the relationship between the linear
    predictor and E(Y) through the link function.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let us revisit Homer and Lisa’s situation using a simpler but related approach.
    Rather than implementing a GLM, we can transform the data by taking the natural
    logarithm of prices before applying a linear model. This implies we are modeling
    prices as following a log-normal distribution (Figure 1 presents the distribution
    of prices and the log version). When transforming predictions back to the original
    scale, we need to account for the bias introduced by the log transformation using
    Duan’s smearing estimator (Duan, 1983). Using this bias-corrected log-normal model
    and fitting it on properties around Paris, their current 2-room, 40m² flat is
    estimated at 337,844€, while their target 4-room, 90m² property would cost around
    751,884€, hence a need for an additional 414,040€.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The log-normal model with smearing correction is particularly suitable for this
    context because it not only reflects multiplicative relationships, such as price
    increasing proportionally (by a factor) rather than by a fixed amount when the
    number of rooms or surface area increases, but also properly accounts for the
    retransformation bias that would otherwise lead to systematic underestimation
    of prices.

- en: To better understand the uncertainty in these predictions, we can examine their
    confidence intervals. The 95% bootstrap confidence interval [400,740€ — 418,618€]
    for the mean price difference means that if we were to repeat this sampling process
    many times, about 95% of such intervals would contain the true mean price difference.
    This interval is more reliable in this context than the standard error-based 95%
    confidence interval because it does not depend on strict parametric assumptions
    about the model, such as the distribution of errors or the adequacy of the model’s
    specification. Instead, it captures the observed data’s variability and complexity,
    accounting for unmodeled factors and potential deviations from idealized assumptions.
    For instance, our model only considers the number of rooms and surface area, while
    real estate prices in Paris are influenced by many other factors — proximity to
    metro stations, architectural style, floor level, building condition, and local
    neighborhood dynamics, and even broader economic conditions such as prevailing
    interest rates.

- en: In light of this analysis, the log-normal model provides a new and arguably
    more realistic point estimate of 414,040€ for the price difference. However, the
    confidence interval, while statistically rigorous, might not be the most useful
    for Homer and Lisa’s practical planning needs. Instead, to better understand the
    full range of possible prices and provide more actionable insights for their planning,
    we might turn to Bayesian modeling. This approach would allow us to estimate the
    complete probability distribution of potential price differences, rather than
    just point estimates and confidence intervals.

    — what we consider reasonable based on existing knowledge. In practice, this involves
    defining prior distributions for the parameters of the model (e.g., the weights
    of the number of rooms and surface area) and specifying how we believe the data
    is generated through a likelihood function (which gives us the probability of
    observing prices given our model parameters). We then incorporate actual sales
    data (our “evidence”) into the model. By combining these through Bayes’ theorem,
    we derive the “posterior distribution,” which provides an updated view of the
    parameters and predictions, reflecting the uncertainty in our estimates given
    the data. This posterior distribution is what Homer and Lisa would truly find
    valuable.

    to be a reasonable assumption for the likelihood. This choice should be validated
    with posterior predictive checks to ensure it adequately captures the data’s characteristics.
    For the parameters, Half-Gaussian distributions constrained to be positive can
    reflect our assumption that prices increase with the number of rooms and surface
    area. The width of these priors reflects the range of possible effects, capturing
    our uncertainty in how much prices increase with additional rooms or surface area.

    type. The overlapping regions between the two distributions reveal that housing

    — from point estimates to distributional thinking — we deliberately kept our models
    simple. The OLS and *pseudo*-GLM implementations were used without interaction
    terms — and thus without regularization or hyperparameter tuning — and minimal
    preprocessing was applied. While the high correlation between the number of rooms
    and surface area is not particularly problematic for predictive modeling in general,
    it can affect the sampling efficiency of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods
    used in our Bayesian models by creating ridges in the posterior distribution that
    are harder to explore efficiently (indeed, we observed a strong ridge structure
    with correlation of -0.74 between these parameters, though effective sample sizes
    remained reasonable at about 50% of total samples, suggesting our inference should
    be sufficiently stable for our illustrative purposes). For the Bayesian approaches
    specifically, there is substantial room for improvement through defining more
    informative priors or the inclusion of additional covariates. While such optimizations
    might yield somewhat different numerical results, they would likely not fundamentally
    alter the key insights about the importance of considering full distributions
    rather than point estimates.
