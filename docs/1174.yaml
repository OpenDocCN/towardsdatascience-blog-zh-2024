    trained with text. We often forget that text is a sequence of characters and they
    can be assembled in complex ways to achieve infinite and complex meanings. Similarly,
    life is composed of just a few basic characters (only 4 for [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA)
    and 20 for [proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein)) and their infinite
    combinations have allowed us to have such incredible biodiversity today.

    sequences why not exploit language models with DNA and protein sequences?
