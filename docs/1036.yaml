    platform using SAP business data on procurement processes. As I progressed, several
    questions arise regarding data modeling and finding my way through the various
    tables of SAP’s database.

    future dashboards, reports, and other analytical outputs planned in the next steps.
    To achieve this, I had to fully understand SAP data architecture basics, tables
    mapping and so on. It was not an easy task but I managed to grasp this new knowledge

    beneficial to integrate data from SAP and model it for front-end use to provide
    an end-to-end view of business processes and identify inefficiencies. However,
    it can be challenging without first understanding how the data is organized in
    SAP.

    all the data generated by SAP transactions, such as creating a vendor or a purchase
    order in the case of procurement functions. It’s also important to note that while
    some tables remain stable over time, others store data capturing specific business
    events crucial for daily operations. The example of creating a vendor or a purchase
    order in SAP illustrates this point well.
  prefs: []

    would have a vendor table listing those they frequently work with to purchase
    the materials needed to manufacture cars and other items. The creation of a new
    vendor in this table is a rare event that may only occur a few times per year.
    **This table is referred to as a Master Table, which only stores Master Data.**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Meanwhile, creating a purchase order is an operational task. Purchasing teams
    within the same company frequently use MM (Material Management) transactions to
    create purchase orders (e.g. millions of purchase orders). **Consequently, the
    table storing all these purchase orders is referred to as a Transaction Table,
    and this type of data is known as Transaction Data.**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both tables in SAP ECC and S/4 HANA have specific names. **The Vendor Master
    Table is known as the LFA1 table, while Purchase Orders are found in the EKKO
    Table.** For someone working with SAP tables for the first time, it may not be
    immediately clear what each table represents based on its name. For instance,
    if I mention the names MCHA, MSEG, BSEG, etc., you would know these are SAP tables,
    but wouldn’t necessarily know what information they store. Do they contain production
    orders, financial accounts, or invoices?

    and memorize the tables within my project’s scope. More importantly, I needed
    to understand the relationships and fields used in each table. At this stage,
    it’s also important to map this data for quick comprehension.

    both the data architecture of SAP and how procurement business processes are defined.
    Thankfully, my previous experience working on process improvement projects with
    procurement teams was beneficial when it came to procurement processes. Before
    stepping into the SAP Data Model or Mapping of procurement tables, let’s briefly
    review the main objects handled in a procurement process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To simplify, procurement is the process of purchasing something, which could
    be raw materials, services, tools, etc., from a vendor. **This process involves
    receiving the purchased items, verifying their condition, and then initiating
    the payment process, often referred to as the Accounting Payable process**. However,
    we will not cover this process in our scope.

    the header level and the item level. This is because, conceptually, a document
