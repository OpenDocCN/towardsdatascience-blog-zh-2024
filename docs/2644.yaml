    enhances decision making, and creates new value for customers. Across the organization
    — product management, marketing, operations, finance, and more — teams are overflowing
    with ideas on how data can elevate the business. To bring these ideas to life,
    companies are eagerly hiring data scientists for their technical skills (Python,
    statistics, machine learning, SQL, etc.).
  prefs: []

    data scientists. Organizations remain narrowly focused on employing data scientists
    to execute preexisting ideas, overlooking the broader value they bring. Beyond
    their skills, data scientists possess a unique perspective that allows them to
    come up with innovative business ideas of their own — ideas that are novel, strategic,
    or differentiating and are unlikely to come from anyone but a data scientist.

    the ideas of data scientists. Instead, they treat data scientists as a resource
    to be used for their skills alone. Functional teams provide requirements documents
    with fully specified plans: “Here’s how you are to build this new system for us.
    Thank you for your partnership.” No context is provided, and no input is sought
    — other than an estimate for delivery. Data scientists are further inundated with
    ad hoc requests for tactical analyses or operational dashboards¹. The backlog
    of requests grows so large that the work queue is managed through Jira-style ticketing
    systems, which strip the requests of any business context (e.g., “get me the top
    products purchased by VIP customers”). One request begets another², creating a
    Sisyphean endeavor that leaves no time for data scientists to think for themselves.
    And then there’s the myriad of opaque requests for data pulls: “Please get me
    this data so ***I*** can analyze it.” This is marginalizing — like asking Steph
    Curry to pass the ball so ***you*** can take the shot. It’s not a partnership;
    it’s a subordination that reduces data science to a mere support function, executing
    ideas from other teams. While executing tasks may produce some value, it won’t
    tap into the full potential of what data scientists truly have to offer.'

    requirements or requests but in their ideas for transforming a business. By “ideas”
    I mean new capabilities or strategies that can move the business in better or
    new directions — leading to increased³ revenue, profit, or customer retention
    while simultaneously providing a sustainable competitive advantage (i.e., capabilities
    or strategies that are difficult for competitors to replicate). These ideas often
    take the form of machine learning algorithms that can automate decisions within
    a production system⁴. For example, a data scientist might develop an algorithm
    to better manage inventory by optimally balancing overage and underage costs.
    Or they might create a model that detects hidden customer preferences, enabling
    more effective personalization. If these sound like business ideas, that’s because
    they are — but they’re not likely to come from business teams. Ideas like these
    typically emerge from data scientists, whose unique cognitive repertoires and
    observations in the data make them well-suited to uncovering such opportunities.

    individual can draw upon for thinking, problem-solving, or processing information
    (Page 2017). These repertoires are shaped by our backgrounds — education, experience,
    training, and so on. Members of a given functional team often have similar repertoires
    due to their shared backgrounds. For example, marketers are taught frameworks
    like [SWOT analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis) and [ROAS](https://www.adjust.com/glossary/roas-definition/),
    while finance professionals learn models such as [ROIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_capital)

    backgrounds may vary — ranging from statistics to computer science to computational
    neuroscience — they typically share a quantitative tool kit. This includes frameworks
    for widely applicable problems, often with accessible names like the “[newsvendor
    model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsvendor_model),” the “[traveling salesman
    problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem),” the “[birthday
    problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem),” and many others. Their
    tool kit also includes knowledge of machine learning algorithms⁵ like neural networks,
    clustering, and principal components, which are used to find empirical solutions
    to complex problems. Additionally, they include heuristics such as big O notation,
    the central limit theorem, and significance thresholds. All of these constructs
    can be expressed in a common mathematical language, making them easily transferable
    across different domains, including business — perhaps especially business.

    since, in many industries⁶, the conditions for learning from data are nearly ideal
    in that they have high-frequency events, a clear objective function⁷, and timely
    and unambiguous feedback. Retailers have millions of transactions that produce
    revenue. A streaming service sees millions of viewing events that signal customer
    interest. And so on — millions or billions of events with clear signals that are
    revealed quickly. These are the units of induction that form the basis for learning,
    especially when aided by machines. The data science repertoire, with its unique
    frameworks, machine learning algorithms, and heuristics, is remarkably geared
    for extracting knowledge from large volumes of event data.

    scientist, while attending a business meeting, will regularly experience pangs
    of inspiration. Her eyebrows raise from behind her laptop as an operations manager
    describes an inventory perishability problem, lobbing the phrase “We need to buy
    enough, but not too much.” “Newsvendor model,” the data scientist whispers to
    herself. A product manager asks, “How is this process going to scale as the number
    of products increases?” The data scientist involuntarily scribbles “*O(N²)*” on
    her notepad, which is big O notation to indicate that the process will scale superlinearly.
    And when a marketer brings up the topic of customer segmentation, bemoaning, “There
    are so many customer attributes. How do we know which ones are most important?,”
    the data scientist sends a text to cancel her evening plans. Instead, tonight
    she will eagerly try running principal components analysis on the customer data⁸.

    of reviewing the state of the business. Yet the data scientist is practically
    goaded into ideating. “Oh, oh. I got this one,” she says to herself. Ideation
    can even be hard to suppress. Yet many companies unintentionally seem to suppress
    that creativity. In reality our data scientist probably wouldn’t have been invited
    to that meeting. Data scientists are not typically invited to operating meetings.
    Nor are they typically invited to ideation meetings, which are often limited to
    the business teams. Instead, the meeting group will assign the data scientist
    Jira tickets of tasks to execute. Without the context, the tasks will fail to
    inspire ideas. The cognitive repertoire of the data scientist goes unleveraged
    — a missed opportunity to be sure.

    that makes their ideas uniquely valuable. Because they are so deeply immersed
    in the data, data scientists discover unforeseen patterns and insights that inspire
    novel business ideas. They are novel in the sense that no one would have thought
    of them — not product managers, executives, marketers — not even a data scientist

    is asked to compile a list of the top products purchased by a particular customer
    segment. To her surprise, the products bought by the various segments are hardly
    different at all. Most products are bought at about the same rate by all segments.
    Weird. The segments are based on profile descriptions that customers opted into,
    and for years the company had assumed them to be meaningful groupings useful for
    managing products. “There must be a better way to segment customers,” she thinks.
    She explores further, launching an informal, impromptu analysis. No one is asking
    her to do this, but she can’t help herself. Rather than relying on the labels
    customers use to describe themselves, she focuses on their actual behavior: what
    products they click on, view, like, or dislike. Through a combination of quantitative
    techniques — matrix factorization and principal component analysis — she comes
    up with a way to place customers into a multidimensional space. Clusters of customers
    adjacent to one another in this space form meaningful groupings that better reflect
    customer preferences. The approach also provides a way to place products into
    the same space, allowing for distance calculations between products and customers.
    This can be used to recommend products, plan inventory, target marketing campaigns,
    and many other business applications. All of this is inspired from the surprising
    observation that the tried-and-true customer segments did little to explain customer
    behavior. Solutions like this have to be driven by observation since, absent the
    data saying otherwise, no one would have thought to inquire about a better way
    to group customers.'

    belongs to a class of algorithms called “unsupervised learning,” which further
    exemplifies the concept of observation-driven insights. Unlike “supervised learning,”
    in which the user instructs the algorithm what to look for, an unsupervised learning
    algorithm lets the data describe how it is structured. It is evidence based; it
    quantifies and ranks each dimension, providing an objective measure of relative
    importance. The data does the talking. Too often we try to direct the data to
    yield to our human-conceived categorization schemes, which are familiar and convenient
    to us, evoking visceral and stereotypical archetypes. It’s satisfying and intuitive

    Of course, she exercised her cognitive repertoire to do the work, but the entire
    analysis was inspired by observation of the data. For the company, such distractions

    better inventory management practices, better pricing structures, new merchandising
    strategies, improved user experience designs, and many other capabilities — none
    of which were asked for but instead were discovered by observation in the data.

    the point of this article. The problem arises when data scientists are valued
    only for their technical skills. Viewing them solely as a support team limits
    them to answering specific questions, preventing deeper exploration of insights
    in the data. The pressure to respond to immediate requests often causes them to
    overlook anomalies, unintuitive results, and other potential discoveries. If a
    data scientist were to suggest some exploratory research based on observations,
    the response is almost always, “No, just focus on the Jira queue.” Even if they
    spend their own time — nights and weekends — researching a data pattern that leads
    to a promising business idea, it may still face resistance simply because it wasn’t
    planned or on the roadmap. Roadmaps tend to be rigid, dismissing new opportunities,
    even valuable ones. In some organizations, data scientists may pay a price for
    exploring new ideas. Data scientists are often judged by how well they serve functional
    teams, responding to their requests and fulfilling short-term needs. There is
    little incentive to explore new ideas when doing so detracts from a performance
    review. In reality, data scientists frequently find new insights in spite of their
    jobs, not because of them.

    any impact at all or actually hurt metrics. (See some statistics [here](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-sobering-truth-about-the-impact-of-your-business-ideas/).)
    Given the poor success rates, innovative companies construct portfolios of ideas
    in the hopes that at least a few successes will allow them to reach their goals.
    Still savvier companies use experimentation¹⁰ (A/B testing) to try their ideas
    on small samples of customers, allowing them to assess the impact before deciding
    to roll them out more broadly.
  prefs: []

    quantity and diversity of ideas¹¹. It’s similar to diversifying a portfolio of
    stocks. Increasing the number of ideas in the portfolio increases exposure to
    a positive outcome — an idea that makes a material positive impact on the company.
    Of course, as you add ideas, you also increase the risk of bad outcomes — ideas
    that do nothing or even have a negative impact. However, many ideas are reversible
    — the “two-way door” that Amazon’s Jeff Bezos speaks of (Haden 2018). Ideas that
    don’t produce the expected results can be pruned after being tested on a small
    sample of customers, greatly mitigating the impact, while successful ideas can
    be rolled out to all relevant customers, greatly amplifying the impact.

    of downside — the more, the better¹². However, there is an assumption that the
    ideas are independent (uncorrelated). If all the ideas are similar, then they
    may all succeed or fail together. This is where diversity comes in. Ideas from
    different groups will leverage divergent cognitive repertoires and different sets
    of information. This makes them different and less likely to be correlated with
    each other, producing more varied outcomes. For stocks, the return on a diverse
    portfolio will be the average of the returns for the individual stocks. However,
    for ideas, since experimentation lets you mitigate the bad ones and amplify the
    good ones, the return of the portfolio can be closer to the return of the best
    idea (Page 2017).

    strengthened through collaboration between data scientists and business teams¹³.
    When they work together, their combined repertoires fill in each other’s blind
    spots (Page 2017)¹⁴. By merging the unique expertise and insights from multiple
    teams, ideas become more robust, much like how diverse groups tend to excel in
    trivia competitions. However, organizations must ensure that true collaboration
    happens at the ideation stage rather than dividing responsibilities such that
    business teams focus solely on generating ideas and data scientists are relegated
