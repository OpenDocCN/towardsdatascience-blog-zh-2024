    the Milky Way galaxy? Sounds like a plot twist from your favorite sci-fi show,
    right? But what if I said we could use data science to get closer to an answer?
    That’s exactly what we’ll be doing in this series, using real numbers to estimate
    how many alien civilizations might exist, how close they could be, and whether
    we have any chance of ever contacting them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this series, we’ll be working through the **Drake Equation**, which has been
    the go-to tool for scientists since the 1960s when it comes to estimating how
    many advanced alien civilizations are out there. We’ll be spicing things up with
    modern data science techniques like **Monte Carlo simulations**, which are essentially
    fancy ways of saying, “Let’s run the numbers thousands of times and see what happens.”

    The universe is unimaginably vast, with **billions of stars** just in our galaxy,
    and each of these stars likely has planets. So why haven’t we met any aliens yet?
    That’s the **Fermi Paradox** — the contradiction between the high probability
    of extraterrestrial life and the lack of evidence for or contact with any alien
    civilizations.

    in 1961\. It’s a way of breaking down the problem into smaller steps, asking questions

    could support life?” Each of these questions narrows down the search, and at the
    end, we get a number that tells us how many civilizations might be out there,
    sending signals into space.'

    formation in our galaxy. However, for this specific analysis, we’ll focus on the

    where life could exist. The average number of stars came out to around **28.75
    billion**, which means we’re looking at quite a few potential homes for alien
    life. This estimate doesn’t come out of nowhere — we defined this range based
    on existing research in astronomy, and we assumed the distribution would be bell-shaped
    to reflect the natural uncertainty in the data.

    does. The next step is to figure out how many of these stars actually have planetary
    systems — and that’s where **Step 2** comes in.
