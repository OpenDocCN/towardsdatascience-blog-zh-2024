- en: 'This article will explore how *Yellowbrick* and *PiML''*s Python packages can
    help data practitioners better understand their data and models, addressing various
    data and model quality issues. Even in the era of *LLMs*, which can perform many
    data science tasks, understanding and utilizing tools such as *Yellowbrick* and
    *PiML* is important for several reasons: (a) they offer powerful visual insights
    into your data and models, (b) they can be used as education tools, particularly
    in the area of analyzing model performance, (c ) they are efficient in terms of
    cost and resources and (c ) they offer data privacy. All training and visualizations
    can be in-house without transferring your data to a cloud-based server.'
