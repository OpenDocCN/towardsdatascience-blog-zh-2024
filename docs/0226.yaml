- en: In my [previous article](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/a-new-look-at-the-central-limit-theorem-d80735682f90),
    I introduced you to the Central Limit Theorem. We disassembled its definition,
    looked at its applications, and watched it do its magic in a simulation.

    mathematician about **how nature behaves when confronted with a large collection
    of anything**. A question that was to lead to the discovery of the **Central Limit
    Theorem** more than a century later.

    who pondered over it, and into the big discovery that unfolded from it.

    first-born son of the large Bernoulli family of Basel in present day Switzerland
    started working on the 4th and final part of his magnum opus titled *Ars Conjectandi*
    (*The Art of the Conjecture*). In the 4th part, Bernoulli focused on Probability
    and its use in…
