However, companies like Mistral AI, Meta and now even Microsoft (not OpenAI) [3] started putting out high quality open source software (OSS) pre-trained base models like Mistral, and LLAMA respectively which changed the game. All of a sudden, smaller firms and even individuals started creating specialized models and publishing them on <a class="af pa" href="https://huggingface.co" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">huggingface.co</a> , the go-to-destination for all OSS models. Some really interesting models started to emerge, like Samantha [4], a pseudo-sentient LLM , and Meditron [5] , a medically astute LLM.</p><p id="ba12" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nz oa fq ob b go ov od oe gr ow og oh oi ox ok ol om oy oo op oq oz os ot ou fj bk">Of relevance to software engineering, a plethora of coding-specific large language models started to emerge, such as codellama, deepseek coder, phi and many more. Salesforce, the company I work in, also released CodeGen [6]. And, like anything else that catches fire in the OSS world, these models are destined to get better and better. We shall see LLMs develop bigger and more complex and sophisticated types of software more and more autonomously.</p><p id="c964" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nz oa fq ob b go ov od oe gr ow og oh oi ox ok ol om oy oo op oq oz os ot ou fj bk">Another crucial reason why open-source LLMs are important is because of Intellectual Property concerns. Not all firms are comfortable sending their AI work to openAI, which really only is an external API hosting their closed source models. Behind this API. firms have no way of knowing how their data is being used or shared. OSS quells this concern obviously. With OSS, your IP doesn’t leave your laptop, your data centers, or your AWS Virtual Private Cloud.</p><h1 id="d494" class="nd ne fq bf nf ng nh gq ni nj nk gt nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny bk">Here come “Small Language Models”</h1><p id="2694" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nz oa fq ob b go oc od oe gr of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou fj bk">For any sort of low or no cost development, rapid prototyping needs to be able to happen on an engineer’s laptop. While LLMs trained with 7B or even 11B parameters can run on reasonably decent laptops, these still take up a bunch of RAM and CPU/GPU. Also, you can forget about running LLMs beyond 30B parameters, unless you have a really beefy machine. Further, when you have to productionize any always-on capabilities which incorporate these models, you can expect an expensive hosting/cloud bill. To combat this barrier of entry, companies like Microsoft started researching [7] how to create base models which are much smaller and still performant and later open sourced small language models, Phi-2 [3]. Their primary vehicle was to use <strong class="ob fr">high quality “textbook-level” data [8]</strong> to train these models instead of vast swaths of low quality of mixed reliability internet data.</p><p id="4d02" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nz oa fq ob b go ov od oe gr ow og oh oi ox ok ol om oy oo op oq oz os ot ou fj bk">Research in this area will continue to accelerate in 2024 as this starts opening the possibility of small models running locally on smaller form-factor electronics like smart phones and even raspberry Pis.

Finally an AI writer can even go and create technical documentation in the end! Further, there is an option to keep the “human-in-the-loop” if one so wishes. At any step of the way, humans can be introduced to course-correct, be it correcting requirements, changing the user acceptance of the plan, changing the aesthetics of a user interface, or functionality of an API.

Sustaining innovation involves enhancing existing technologies, where new market entrants often struggle to compete against established companies who can easily integrate such improvements into their existing products. On the other hand, disruptive innovation emerges when products become overly sophisticated for their market, leading to an “over-served” market. This creates opportunities for new innovations that, although they might be inferior to current state-of-the-art products, offer functionality at a lower cost or in a manner unattainable by the leading products.</em></p><p id="e348" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nz oa fq ob b go ov od oe gr ow og oh oi ox ok ol om oy oo op oq oz os ot ou fj bk">Ok, now that you got a refresher of this concept, hold this thought!

All the stages of new technology development, from prototype to Minimum Viable Product (MVP) would be measured in weeks. It would get easier and cheaper for VCs to fund these companies, as they would be able to easily pivot when the promising product turns out to be a dud. These firms will start infiltrating all industries, from taxes to medical care management, and will either start to threaten the incumbents or would get acquired (or aqui-hired given the number of employees would be so small). More importantly, they would rapidly reduce the perception of time-to-market for products in the eyes of the customer, which would all but force the existing successful firms to disrupt themselves.</p><p id="b27d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nz oa fq ob b go ov od oe gr ow og oh oi ox ok ol om oy oo op oq oz os ot ou fj bk">So, back to Clayton’s concept around disruptive technologies… AI-SWE is going to be inferior to human software engineering in the beginning, but nothing will be able to compete with its dramatic speed, and low cost. Customers will do a cost-benefit assessment and choose to bypass bells and whistles and select simpler but much cheaper alternatives which have the ability to evolve rapidly. All the AI-native firms have to ensure is to not compromise on the fundamentals like reliability and security and provide the core value that the customers are looking for.</p><h1 id="e3f3" class="nd ne fq bf nf ng nh gq ni nj nk gt nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny bk">How does this impact IT</h1><p id="7c60" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nz oa fq ob b go oc od oe gr of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou fj bk">Currently in existing successful companies, IT (centralized or distributed) builds or buys much of the technology that is used to “go to market”.

Examples include weekly leadership reports, status updates to senior leadership, coordination meetings across multiple domains. Typically any work that is driven by Technical Program Managers can be included in this bucket.

My initial experimentation with autonomous AI surfaced various such challenges with deploying software in environments (I’ll document them later in a more technical writeup). There is the matter of authentication management of the application beyond a “local” setup. There may be some manual steps a developer needs to take to be fully provisioned in deploying to that environment. Such a setup would need to be replicated for each AI agent, and obviously automated as much as possible to easily be able to add AI agent capacity with minimal manual effort. In short, detailed “low-level” documentation of what it takes a software engineer starting from scratch in developing some software locally, then deploying to a shared QA environment , and then promoting that code to higher environments all the way into production is essential to identify the roadblocks an AI-agent will face.</p><p id="7080" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nz oa fq ob b go ov od oe gr ow og oh oi ox ok ol om oy oo op oq oz os ot ou fj bk">In many cases we will need to be ready to not have a 100% path of automated continuous <strong class="ob fr">deployment</strong> (CD) to production in the beginning if CD is not in place for human-driven software engineering (H-SWE) today. For instance, if there are humans involved in the change and release management process to ship features to production today, that would still be there when semi-autonomous AI-SWE teams are creating software features by themselves. That doesn’t stop the AI-SWE teams from creating and surfacing all required documentation and testing output to the change board and release managers. (Over time, change and release processes can definitely be powered by AI (not coding, but reasoning) agents as well but that is beyond the scope of this document)</p><p id="fbba" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nz oa fq ob b go ov od oe gr ow og oh oi ox ok ol om oy oo op oq oz os ot ou fj bk">Similar to the software process evaluation, environment evaluation will also show what other capabilities need to be streamlined for AI-SWE to be able to stay as autonomous as code gets promoted through higher environments all the way to production.</p><p id="f994" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nz oa fq ob b go ov od oe gr ow og oh oi ox ok ol om oy oo op oq oz os ot ou fj bk"><strong class="ob fr">3.

However, a careful evaluation of the complexity of processes surrounding each application’s SDLC, the maturity of the AI-coder LLMs for each application’s language, and the level of impact of AI-SWE on that application will be required. Just like in story pointing, Fibonacci scoring can be used against the cost and benefit dimensions and an overall ROI metric can be created which can help executives decide the order of the AI-SWE agent deployment (more in Phase 2 below).</p><p id="5347" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nz oa fq ob b go ov od oe gr ow og oh oi ox ok ol om oy oo op oq oz os ot ou fj bk"><strong class="ob fr">Important note: </strong>At the <em class="pd">bottom</em> of the priority list of applications need to be all those applications where there is already significant context loss [18].

As an executive I love defining timelines, because it forces my team and I to think in terms of real dates, and deadlines, and enables us to think about all aspects and stages of the project holistically. Of course, “no plan survives first contact with the enemy” as Sun Tzu stated. These timelines do, and will change, especially since this type of work has never been done before. We truly don’t know what surprises are in store for us on this journey, and there is no user manual out there for this yet. (In fact, to the best of my knowledge, this article may be the first real attempt at a framework from an experienced product leader who’s been in the trenches).</p><p id="1421" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nz oa fq ob b go ov od oe gr ow og oh oi ox ok ol om oy oo op oq oz os ot ou fj bk">All those aside, the plan will still give a clear baseline and identify all the assumptions. As surprises emerge, the plan can be reviewed and adjusted. However, those deadlines will still be out there, publicly communicated and they always drive a healthy pressure on the team to keep sharp focus and deliver. For all new projects or features, I always say:</p><blockquote class="pr"><p id="f430" class="ps pt fq bf pu pv pw px py pz qa ou dx">“dates can’t change but scope can”</p></blockquote><p id="0045" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nz oa fq ob b go qu od oe gr qv og oh oi qw ok ol om qx oo op oq qy os ot ou fj bk"><strong class="ob fr">5.

It would be good to have some high level clarity on which horse to back (aka which base models to fine tune). These models should be able to serve the maximum number of the applications in the first quartile of the priority list coming out of step 3 above. However, we must be able to stay flexible here. This space is rapidly evolving and innovation may come out later this year that requires us to change our choices. What is important here is to focus on the non-regrettables, by asking questions such as:</p><ul class=""><li id="0fd3" class="nz oa fq ob b go ov od oe gr ow og oh oi ox ok ol om oy oo op oq oz os ot ou pe pf pg bk">Does the AI technology (the multi-agent frameworks etc) allow us to translate architecture, handling coding, debugging, QA and operations tasks?</li><li id="de53" class="nz oa fq ob b go ph od oe gr pi og oh oi pj ok ol om pk oo op oq pl os ot ou pe pf pg bk">Do these frameworks allow us to easily swap LLMs?</li><li id="e05c" class="nz oa fq ob b go ph od oe gr pi og oh oi pj ok ol om pk oo op oq pl os ot ou pe pf pg bk">Are there common benchmarks we can define which enable us to evaluate the framework’s performance?</li></ul><p id="328e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nz oa fq ob b go ov od oe gr ow og oh oi ox ok ol om oy oo op oq oz os ot ou fj bk">This selection must be based on multiple proof of concepts which show how AI-SWE can integrate with environments and software tooling.

The POCs here should focus on simple but real use cases that are applicable within IT. It is these POCs which will give us some level of confidence and show a realistic delta from here to the desired target state which we can put a reasonable level of effort estimation against.</p><p id="7bdb" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nz oa fq ob b go ov od oe gr ow og oh oi ox ok ol om oy oo op oq oz os ot ou fj bk">To work on this evaluation and planning assessment, I recommend a small team comprising of:</p><ul class=""><li id="5a7c" class="nz oa fq ob b go ov od oe gr ow og oh oi ox ok ol om oy oo op oq oz os ot ou pe pf pg bk">a competent software engineering leader who knows how the sausage factory works in terms of software creation in the firm, and is knowledgeable and passionate about the intersection of generative AI.

AI Model Quality Assurance (QA): Test AI models to ensure they meet functional requirements and performance benchmarks.

In fact, in the beginning creating sample data sets to fine tune the models would likely be done by the AI Development team (1) anyway, and would only hand this work off to this team when scaling out across multiple applications and then multiple domains. I found a prototype [21] put out by Autogen very applicable where, by pointing an AI agent towards decent code documentation (aka Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG) they demonstrated how the AI agent was able to learn syntax of some new methods in the library and provide code based on that.

This may require reviewing and red-lining the existing application documentation (and perhaps code) and collaboration with the existing teams to improve their documentation prior to training.

End to end QA is important since these AI Teams may be developing against separate epics’ user acceptance criteria, but the end to end experience would still need to be verified and integration-tested when all of these come together prior to a release. This also extends across performance testing needs. Eventually, when the muscle is developed well enough, the QA function can also be trained into an LLM, but I foresee it happening later than the Software development function, simply because of the complexity of interdependencies. This still does not preclude the QA function to heavily utilize AI Agents to evaluate, write and deploy automated tests and automated reporting in earlier Phases.</p><h1 id="68c8" class="nd ne fq bf nf ng nh gq ni nj nk gt nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny bk">Exit criteria for Phase 3b</h1><p id="9095" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nz oa fq ob b go oc od oe gr of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou fj bk">Exit criteria for this phase is surprisingly straightforward: A critical mass (80–100% as decided by executive leadership) of functional AI Teams have been deployed and are contributing to each domain and a <strong class="ob fr">clear difference in lead time to change is starting to be observed</strong>.</p><h1 id="cc70" class="nd ne fq bf nf ng nh gq ni nj nk gt nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny bk">Steady State (Phase n) : Scale out AI teams, Decentralize AI shared services</h1><figure class="mm mn mo mp mq mr mj mk paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="ms mt ed mu bh mv"><div class="mj mk rj"><img src="../Images/58dff2796b091a795b953399f2d4f3b9.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*tyL9pO1jEpZMdRzmwUkXJw.png"/></div></div><figcaption class="mx my mz mj mk na nb bf b bg z dx"><em class="nc">Source: Author</em></figcaption></figure><p id="2f45" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nz oa fq ob b go ov od oe gr ow og oh oi ox ok ol om oy oo op oq oz os ot ou fj bk"><strong class="ob fr">Scaling out AI teams</strong></p><p id="6938" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nz oa fq ob b go ov od oe gr ow og oh oi ox ok ol om oy oo op oq oz os ot ou fj bk">By this time the domains are getting comfortable with the quality of the work of the AI teams, and more and more hands-on software engineers start getting upleveled and elevated to become leads, or <strong class="ob fr">AI Engineers [16]</strong>, of their own AI Teams.

The bottleneck of velocity will naturally move to these human AI engineers, but by this time the firm should be enjoying dramatically reduced lead time to changes already. The skills that these AI engineers would need to focus on would still have a modicum of software since they are still on point to review and approve the Pull Requests being sent by the various AI Agents, and review the documentation being created by them and so forth.

This may require the CoE to create its own sentinel software which is able to keep track of secure code and infrastructure across the domains, as well as to automatically track and add items in the backlog of these teams and report on the overall security posture centrally.

The barriers of entry for getting into building software-based technology are going to be wiped out, the lead times from idea to market will reduce, firms previously not even working in the same stratosphere will start competing, and new nimble companies will emerge which will threaten great legacies.
