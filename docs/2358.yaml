    plus a full day’s work. Some people would call me crazy, but here’s the thing:
    the numbers make sense. So when my family and I crunched the data, we decided
    not to move close to the city where my office is. This is the story of how that
    decision unfolded — and what the data shows about it.'

    why I got round to writing this article. With Amazon’s recent announcement about
    [bringing more employees back to the office](https://fortune.com/2024/09/16/andy-jassy-5-days-return-to-office-order-amazon-work-culture-concerns/),
    our data science and data engineering teams have been a bit restless. The tech
    industry is one of those where working from home and hybrid work is more prevalent.
    At Skyscanner, our Data Science discipline is 40+ people strong and is scattered
    across London, Edinburgh, Barcelona and Shenzhen. The same happens to the teams…
