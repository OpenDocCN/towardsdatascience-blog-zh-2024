    Learning model to learn distinctive patterns from the available data. In this
    blog post, we will learn about the concept of *Maximum Likelihood Estimates* via
    its application to the next-word prediction problem to make the explanations more
    intuitive.

    Learning theory. I’ll try my best to keep it as general as possible and would
    provide links to background reading on essential concepts as and when I introduce
    them.'

    of upcoming words. These predictions get better and better as you use the application,
    thus saving users’ effort. Another application for text prediction is in search
    engines. Predictive search saves effort and guides visitors to results, rather
    than having them type searches that are slightly off and don’t return a large
    number of results. As a consumer of these applications, I am sure you would have
    wondered “How exactly does this…
