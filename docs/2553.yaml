    at the start. This extensive guide will walk you through applications, libraries,
    and dependencies of causal discovery approaches.

- en: The endless possibilities of Bayesian techniques are also their weakness; the
    applications are enormous, and it can be troublesome to understand how techniques
    are related to different solutions and thus applications. In my previous blogs,
    I have written about various topics such as structure learning, parameter learning,
    inferences, and a comparative overview of different Bayesian libraries. **In this
    blog post, I will walk you through the landscape of Bayesian applications, and
    describe how applications follow different causal discovery approaches.** In other
    words, *how do you create a causal network (Directed Acyclic Graph) using discrete
    or continuous datasets?* *Can you determine causal networks with(out) response/treatment
    variables?* *How do you decide which search methods to use such as PC, Hillclimbsearch,
    etc?* **After reading this blog you’ll know where to start and how to select the
    most appropriate Bayesian techniques for causal discovery for your use case.**
    *Take your time, grab a*…
