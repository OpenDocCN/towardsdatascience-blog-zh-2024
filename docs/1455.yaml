    and for good reason. Experiments are often initiated from a hypothesis or produce
    data that leads to a hypothesis. Consider, for example, this data set from pharmacologists
    Cushny and Peebles [1]:'

- en: Cushny and Peebles were hoping to find an effective soporific. To that end,
    they dosed patients at the Michigan Asylum for the Insane at Kalamazoo with small
    amounts of different related drugs and measured sleep activity. Their data set
    is somewhat famous [2]. It was one of the first examples Student [9] applied the
    t-distribution to and it was later analyzed by Ronald Fisher in his highly influential
    book *Statistical Methods for Research Workers [15, p. 119]*.

    HBr* more effective than *L-hyoscyamine HBr* at inducing sleep? Is *L-hyoscyamine
    HBr* better than no drug…'
