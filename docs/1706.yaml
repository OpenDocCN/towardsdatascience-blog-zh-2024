    of statistical tools, memorize them, and revisit them, but the concepts still
    don’t stick? You know how to use formulas but feel like that just gives surface-level
    knowledge of the concept. I was in the same boat until I TA’d for a physics lab
    course 105M at UT Austin and applied statistical tools relevant to the problems
    we were solving. It was then that I finally understood the theory and application
    of the Student’s t-Test, and now it truly sticks.

- en: As mentioned earlier, we gathered limited data (**sample**) using just 10 trials
    out of all the possible values (**population**). Note that the calculated best
    estimate is from the sample distribution. However, to get a better estimate of
    the population mean, we calculate the standard error of the sample distribution.
    **The standard error helps us determine the range within which our best estimate
    for the population is likely to fall.** It is based on the variance of the distribution,
    which indicates how disperse the distribution is around mean.

- en: We observe that the best estimates and the standard errors for both balls are
    comparable (there is an overlap between the calculated ranges), prompting us to
    consider that distributions are similar and therfore color may not affect the
    rolling time of the balls. However, **how statistically significant and reliable
    are these findings?** In essence, do these values provide sufficient evidence
    for us to draw conclusions about the hypothesis?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To measure the certainty about our results and present evidence in a more communicable
    way, we use test statistics. **These statistics help us measure the probability
    of obtaining these results, providing a measure of certainty.** For instance,
    we use statistics like z-statistic if the population standard deviation is known
    and the t-statistic if only the sample standard deviation is known, as in our
    experiment.

    on the similarity of the variances between the two groups, we decide between using
    **pooled variance, as in Student’s t-Test for equal variances, or Welch’s t-Test,
    which is for unequal variances.**

    are very similar, we proceed with a **Student’s t-Test for equal variances**.
    We conduct a two-tailed test to check for inequality of distributions rather than
    specifically looking for lesser or greater values.

- en: As we observed, the t-statistic is based on the difference of the means of the
    two samples. In our case, the t-statistic is very small (~-0.38), indicating that
    the difference between the means of the two distributions is also very small.
    This suggests that the recordings for the two balls are similar, hinting at the
    overall conclusion that color has no significant effect on the rolling time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, **interpreting the t-statistic involves more than just observing the
    small difference in means**, especially since we compared only two samples (limited
    trials) and not the entire populations. To make an informed inference, we need
    to determine the critical value and then compare out t-statistic with that critical
    value.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The **critical value** is determined based on the confidence interval (e.g.,
    95%) and the sample sizes (degrees of freedom). A **95% confidence interval**
    (CI) means that if the experiment is repeated several times, the true mean difference
    will fall within 95% of the calculated intervals.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To find the critical value or critical value range in our case (since we are
    checking for inequality), we use the t-distribution table. For a **two-tailed
    test with a 95% CI**, we look at the 0.05 significance level, which splits into
    2.5% for each tail. Given our degrees of freedom (df = 18), the critical value
    range is approximately -2.101 to +2.101.

    that color has no effect on rolling time. Secondly, with 95% certainty, if we
    were to repeat this experiment multiple times, the true difference in means between
    the rolling times of the red and black balls would consistently fall within this
    range.'
