    we also know that different moments call for different types of learning. Here
    at TDS, we’ve traditionally published lots of hands-on, roll-up-your-sleeves guides
    and tutorials as soon as we kick off a new year—and we’re sure that will be the
    case come January 2025, too.

    some of our best recent articles that call for a bit more reflection and a slower
    pace of processing: stories you can savor as you lounge on a comfy armchair, say,
    rather than while typing code away on your laptop (though you can do that too,
    of course; we won’t hold it against you!).'

    performance relative to workers in a given task. If AI is better than labour,
    labour is automated, but if labour is better than AI, AI augments labour.” He
    goes on to unpack the stakes, risks, and potential benefits of AI’s rapidly growing

    to not change as a result of these experiences, and I worry very much that the
    change we’re undergoing is not for the better.”'
