- en: In the rapidly expanding technological world, data-related careers have strongly
    emerged in the market over the past few years, and the demand for a professional
    with skills to understand and translate data skyrocketed. Over the past few years,
    organizations have seen an exponential rise in the quantity and quality of data
    careers, and there has been an equivalent rise in the number of people interested
    in data careers.

    hit from the pandemic, companies are freezing hiring and laying off employees.
    That only scares a professional in the data landscape. In my opinion, you could
    bring the correct set of hard skills to the table but that is not enough. How
    will YOU create a unique and comprehensive value is a more important question
    to the hiring managers.

    I had a lot to learn. Through a year-long internship, I learned, unlearned, and
    developed a sense that soft skills are equally (sometimes more) important with
    having the hard skills like coding and manipulating data.
