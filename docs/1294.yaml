    journey. E.g. Casciaro et al. (2015) advocate for the integration of network and
    psychological perspectives in organizational scholarship, highlighting that such
    interdisciplinary approaches can significantly enrich our understanding of organizational
    behaviors and structures. They emphasize that combining these perspectives reveals
    complex dynamics within organizations that would otherwise remain obscured, especially
    in areas such as leadership, turnover, and team performance. This fusion not only
    advances theoretical models but also suggests practical implications for organizational
    management, urging further exploration of underrepresented areas and methodologies
    (Casciaro et al., 2015).

    Qualitative methods also suffer from limitations like the difficulty to unify

    bias (Nickerson, 1998), but in the age of LLMs, with proper prompting and automation,
    these limitations can be overcome.
