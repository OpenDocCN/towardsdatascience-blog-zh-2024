    most knowledge workers I’ve spoken to don’t use it at all. Those who do primarily
    stick to basic tasks like summarization. [Only a little over 5% of ChatGPT’s user
    base pays for plus](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-coo-says-chatgpt-passed-11-million-paying-subscribers)

    power users leveraging AI for complex, high-value work.

    to make their companies AI-forward, knowing it’s more powerful and user-friendly
    than ever. So why, despite the potential and enthusiasm, is widespread adoption
    lagging? The real roadblock is how organizations approach work itself. Systemic
    issues are keeping these tools from becoming part of our daily grind.

    do things faster? Or can this feature be built with AI? “ but rather “How can
    we use AI to create more value? What are the questions that we should be asking
    but aren’t?”

    like ChatGPT — to tackle a complex data structuring and analysis task that would
    have traditionally taken a cross-functional team of data analysts and content
    designers a month or more.

    and different outcome. LLMs uncovered nuanced patterns and edge cases hidden within
    the unstructured data, creating insights that traditional analysis of pre-existing
    structured data would have missed entirely.

    pressure to deliver immediate results, most rarely have even an hour for this
    type of strategic work — the only way many find time for this kind of exploratory
    work is by pretending to be sick. They are so overwhelmed with executive mandates
    and urgent customer requests that they lack ownership over their strategic direction.
    Furthermore, recent layoffs and other cutbacks in the industry have intensified
    workloads, leaving many PMs working 12-hour days just to keep up with basic tasks.

    robust testing plans or proactively identifying potential issues with AI is viewed
    as a luxury, not a necessity. It sets up a counterproductive dynamic: Why use
    AI to identify issues in your documentation if implementing the fixes will only
    delay launch? Why do additional research on your users and problem space if the
    direction has already been set from above?'

    to understand how to make ChatGPT do more than summarization. However, the training
    required is usually much less than people expect.

    peddle snake oil, many instructors are reputable experts. Still, these classes
    often aren’t right for most people as a starting point. They’re time-consuming,
    overly technical, and rarely tailored to specific lines of work.

    what LLMs could do. The key was tailoring the examples to his domain. We came
    up with a somewhat complex legal gray area and I asked [Claude](https://claude.ai/)
    to explain this to a first year law student with edge case examples. He saw the
    response and immediately understood how he could use the technology for a dozen
    different projects. Twenty minutes later, he was halfway through drafting a new
    law review article he’d been meaning to write for months.

    taken the initiative to explore LLMs in their work. These “LLM whisperers” could

    service manager. Put out a call for these innovators and leverage their expertise.'

    two hour-long “AI audits”, reviewing your team’s current workflows and identifying
    areas for improvement. They can also help create starter prompts for specific
    use cases, share their AI workflows, and give tips on how to troubleshoot and
    evaluate going forward.

    to understand your company’s systems and goals, making them more likely to spot
    practical and relevant opportunities. People hesitant to adopt are also more likely
    to experiment when they see colleagues using the technology compared to “AI experts.”

    to explore and experiment with these tools in their domain once they understand
    their capabilities. Companies can’t simply tell employees to “innovate with AI”
    while simultaneously demanding another month’s worth of features by Friday at
    5pm. Ensure your teams have a few hours a month for exploration.

- en: The AI productivity paradox isn’t about the technology’s complexity, but rather
    how organizations approach work and innovation. Harnessing AI’s power is simpler
    than “AI influencers” selling the latest certification want you to believe — often
    requiring just minutes of targeted training. Yet it demands a fundamental shift
    in leadership mindset. Instead of piling on short-term deliverables, executives
    must create space for exploration and deep, open-ended, goal-driven work. The
    true challenge isn’t teaching AI to your workforce; it’s giving them the time
    and freedom to reinvent how they work.
