- en: One of the tricky parts of my PhD was creating an interactive map visualization
    showcasing the maritime routes of ships from one port to another. The route of
    a ship between an origin and a destination port should be a path solely at sea,
    without crossing any land. Surprisingly, this seemingly straightforward task proved
    to be quite challenging when attempting to implement it from scratch in Python
    ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. While there are commercial solutions like Marine Traffic available for performing
    similar tasks, I was looking for an open-source alternative, which I couldn‚Äôt
    find for a long time. Finally, in late 2022, the SeaRoute library was released
    for Python (previously it was only available for Java), and it made my life a
    lot easier. In this article, I‚Äôll guide you through the process of creating an
    interactive map visualization for a Dash app, allowing you to display sea routes
    using the Dash Leaflet and SeaRoute Python libraries.
