    of what it’s actually like to work there, and often end up disappointed. In this
    article, I will cover the key differences based on my experience working at companies
    ranging from a small 10-person startup to big tech giants like Uber and Meta.
    Hopefully this will help you decide where you want to go.

    Salary Survey](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/2016-data-science-salary-survey-results/))
    and the equity is typically liquid (i.e. you can sell it as soon as it vests)

    have to wait years for your equity to actually be worth something.'

    act as part Data Engineer, part Data Analyst and part Data Scientist. You’ll need
    to figure out how to build out the data infrastructure, make data available to
    business users, define metrics, run experiments, build dashboards, etc.

    develop deep subject matter expertise in one particular area; if this expertise
    is in high demand, specializing like this can be a very lucrative path. In addition,
    anything you do touches millions or even billions of users.'
