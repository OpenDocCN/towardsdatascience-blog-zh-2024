    academics. Academia is a cut-throat industry, with an exceptionally [high failure
    rate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAOs-frRfa4&t=285s). Therefore, it is critical
    for academics to be considered ‘successful’ as early as possible to avoid being

    their work. But how do you measure the quality of their work? A common method
    is [citation count](https://www.stjude.org/research/progress/2020/the-benefits-of-being-highly-cited.html#:~:text=The%20more%20citations%20you%20have,based%20on%20their%20impact%20factor.),

    unexpected/interesting result in your paper. Going back to the original quote,
    do you think a result where there was no difference in honesty between the group
    who signed at the top vs the bottom of a document would have been nearly as influential?
    No, because that would have been the expectation. The conclusion is that there
    is a strong incentive for academics to generate unexpected/interesting results.
    Therefore, in our example, we should understand that there is a strong bias for
    the authors to claim a (significant) difference in honesty between the two groups.

    to be unreproducible by fellow academics](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-39054778).
    Unreproducible means an academic writes a research paper that copies another academic’s
    research paper’s method/experiment, but ends up with significantly different results
    to the original paper. Turning once more to our case study as an example, following
    the impactful success of the research paper, a number of other studies attempted
    to run the same or similar experiment. [All results](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1911695117)
    of the experiments found no correlation between honesty and location of document
    signature. It turned out the original paper’s finding was very likely the result
    of [data fraud](https://datacolada.org/109). As were a [number of other influential

    on average earnings by subject, have a go at answering the following question
    before moving on to the next paragraph: ‘Given people with Medicine degrees earn
    more than the average degree, does it make sense to assume that the Medicine degree
    was the cause of the higher salary?’'

    doctors generally earn a high income. This supports the idea that a Medicine degree
    is the specific reason for average higher future earnings. On the other hand,
    you don’t just need to pick Medicine, you also need to *be* picked for Medicine.
    Given the average A-level results for a UK Medicine graduate is an outstanding
    [AAA](https://www.medify.co.uk/blog/a-level-requirements#:~:text=Most%20medical%20schools%20require%20AAA,each%20medical%20school%20requires%20below.&text=A*AA%20(AAA%20considered%20if,biology%20and%20EPQ%20grade%20B)),
    you could argue the reason for the high average salaries is because the average
    Medicine student is exceptionally cognitively capable (in academia at least),
    which has nothing to do with whether they actually chose Medicine as a degree
    or not.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What about the degree with the second highest average salary, Economics? Unlike
    Medicine, you don’t strictly need an Economics degree to qualify for any specific
    high-paying jobs. I’d argue an Economics degree is much less likely a direct factor
    in increasing a graduate’s future salary. For example, someone who is genuinely
    interested in money at school will be more likely to base their career decisions
    on what pays more. That same person may also be more likely to pick Economics
    at university.** If that’s true, then pushing someone who is not interested in
    money to study Economics may not benefit their future career or financial prospects
    as much as the article is implying.

    no better off than if they hadn’t gone to university at all. It may simply be
    a side effect. For example, in the UK [children with wealthy parents are significantly
    more likely to attend university](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9195/#:~:text=Pupils%20eligible%20for%20free%20school,second%20year%20in%20higher%20education.).
    The wealth of their parents may also have an impact on the child’s high-paying
    job prospects; for example, they might provide invaluable knowledge to their children
    on how to interview, climb the greasy corporate ladder, and/or network. Given
    this thought process, the article’s finding that “For most university graduates,
    having a degree pays” is, at the very least, not a proven fact, and should not
    be treated as such.
