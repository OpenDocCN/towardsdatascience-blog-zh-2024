spontaneously in Large Language Models (LLMs) the way so many reasoning capabilities did. Humans have specialized, highly capable spatial reasoning capabilities that LLMs have not replicated. But every subsequent release of the major models — GPT, Claude, Gemini- promises better multimedia support, and all will accept and try to use uploaded graphics along with texts.</p><p id="a20d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nz oa fq ob b go oc od oe gr of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou fj bk">Spatial reasoning capabilities are being improved through specialized training on the part of the AI providers. Like a student who realizes that they are just not a ‘natural’ in some area, Language Models have had to learn to solve spatial reasoning problems the long way around, cobbling together experiences and strategies, and asking for help from other AI models. Here is my review of current capabilities. It will by turns make you proud to be a human (mental box folding champs!), inspired to try new things with your LLM (better charts and graphs!) and hopefully intrigued by this interesting problem space.</p><h1 id="07f7" class="mj mk fq bf ml mm mn gq mo mp mq gt mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne bk">The Tests</h1><p id="4b35" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nz oa fq ob b go ov od oe gr ow og oh oi ox ok ol om oy oo op oq oz os ot ou fj bk">I have been testing the large, publicly available LLM models for about a year now with a diverse collection of problems of which a few are shown here. Some problems are taken from standard spatial reasoning tests, but most other are originals to avoid the possibility of the LLMs having seen them before. The right way to do this testing would be to put together, test, and publish a large battery of questions across many iterations, perhaps ground it in recent neuroscience, and validate it with human data. For now, I will present some pilot testing — a collection of diverse problems and follow-ups with close attention to the results, especially errors, to get an understanding of the space.</p><h1 id="b671" class="mj mk fq bf ml mm mn gq mo mp mq gt mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne bk">The Models and the State of the Art</h1><p id="8a44" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nz oa fq ob b go ov od oe gr ow og oh oi ox ok ol om oy oo op oq oz os ot ou fj bk">All of the items here were tested with Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4. Many were also tried with Gemini earlier in 2024, which performed poorly overall and results are not shown. I will show only one result for most problems, because the point is to assess the state of the art rather than compare models. Results from Terrible, Improving, and Already Pretty Good are intermixed for narrative; use the headers if you want to skip around.</p><h1 id="9e90" class="mj mk fq bf ml mm mn gq mo mp mq gt mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne bk">Terrible: LLMs cannot mentally fold boxes</h1><p id="77fc" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nz oa fq ob b go ov od oe gr ow og oh oi ox ok ol om oy oo op oq oz os ot ou fj bk">When I started testing LLM spatial reasoning I found examples of those staples of human spatial testing, mental box folding. I planned to start with some simple problems from an online <a class="af pa" href="https://test-preparation.ca/spatial-relations-acuity-folding-tutorial/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">spatial relations problem workbook</a> and then move onto to harder problems as in Fibonicci's <a class="af pa" href="https://www.fibonicci.com/spatial-awareness/spatial-reasoning-test/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">online test</a>.</p><p id="5dc5" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nz oa fq ob b go oc od oe gr of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou fj bk">I never got to the harder problems.

This response was at least as good as any I have received from GPT or Gemini, but still badly wrong. It is interesting to read the LLM response, to understand how it is trying to work through a problem that it does not have the spatial reasoning tools to understand the way a human would.</p><p id="ff04" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nz oa fq ob b go oc od oe gr of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou fj bk"><strong class="ob fr">Question</strong>: When folded, what pattern is possible?</p><figure class="ni nj nk nl nm nn nf ng paragraph-image"><div class="nf ng pb"><img src="../Images/1213f4acd5001b153801c3e5c24e0517.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:938/format:webp/1*AYtbgoPRCdySOX8MPjkdvg.png"/></div><figcaption class="nt nu nv nf ng nw nx bf b bg z dx">Used with permission from Complete Test Preparation inc. <a class="af pa" href="https://test-preparation.ca/spatial-relations-acuity-folding-tutorial/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">https://test-preparation.ca/spatial-relations-acuity-folding-tutorial/</a></figcaption></figure><blockquote class="pc pd pe"><p id="4b25" class="nz oa pf ob b go oc od oe gr of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou fj bk"><strong class="ob fr">Claude Sonnet-3.5:</strong></p><p id="becd" class="nz oa pf ob b go oc od oe gr of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou fj bk">To solve this problem, we need to analyze how the unfolded pattern on the left could form a cube, and then compare it to the options A, B, C, and D.</p><p id="53a4" class="nz oa pf ob b go oc od oe gr of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou fj bk">Looking at the unfolded pattern:</p><p id="b333" class="nz oa pf ob b go oc od oe gr of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou fj bk">· The top face has one dot</p><p id="cdf8" class="nz oa pf ob b go oc od oe gr of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou fj bk">· The middle face has two dots</p><p id="1f4c" class="nz oa pf ob b go oc od oe gr of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou fj bk">· The bottom face has three dots</p><p id="ed72" class="nz oa pf ob b go oc od oe gr of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou fj bk">Now, let’s examine each option:</p><p id="7026" class="nz oa pf ob b go oc od oe gr of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou fj bk">A: This cube shows 3, 2, and 1 dots on visible faces.

We need to determine if G intersects with A</p><p id="0d58" class="nz oa pf ob b go oc od oe gr of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou fj bk">Let’s think about this logically:</p><p id="4737" class="nz oa pf ob b go oc od oe gr of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou fj bk">· G encompasses F, which means F is entirely within G</p><p id="ce15" class="nz oa pf ob b go oc od oe gr of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou fj bk">· F is formed by the overlap of B and D</p><p id="8bea" class="nz oa pf ob b go oc od oe gr of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou fj bk">· A overlaps with B to form C</p><p id="0eaf" class="nz oa pf ob b go oc od oe gr of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou fj bk">Since G encompasses F, and F is formed by B and D, we know that G must at least partially cover B. However, we don’t have direct information about G’s relationship with A.</p><p id="a1c7" class="nz oa pf ob b go oc od oe gr of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou fj bk">The key here is that we don’t have enough information to definitively say whether G intersects with A or not. It’s possible that:</p><p id="f5f9" class="nz oa pf ob b go oc od oe gr of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou fj bk">1. G could be large enough to encompass or intersect with A, or</p><p id="97bf" class="nz oa pf ob b go oc od oe gr of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou fj bk">2. G could be limited to just covering F (and possibly parts of B and D) without touching A</p><p id="84f1" class="nz oa pf ob b go oc od oe gr of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou fj bk">Without more specific information about the size and placement of G in relation to A, we cannot determine for certain whether G intersects with A.</p><p id="f3b8" class="nz oa pf ob b go oc od oe gr of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou fj bk">Therefore, the answer is: We don’t have enough information to determine if G intersects with A.</p><p id="687d" class="nz oa pf ob b go oc od oe gr of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou fj bk">Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this explanation?</p></blockquote><p id="b797" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nz oa fq ob b go oc od oe gr of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou fj bk">Claude’s answer is correct: G and A could intersect, but do not have to given the information provided. GPT-4 also gave an answer that was not wrong, but less clearly stated.</p><p id="ee8b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nz oa fq ob b go oc od oe gr of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou fj bk">Drawing Venn diagrams is still quite out of reach for both models, however.

This capability did seem to ‘emerge’, i.e. LLMs taught themselves the skill to a surprising level of initial proficiency through their base training. This valuable skill has been improved through feedback and fine-tuning since. I always use an LLM assistant now when I produce figures, charts or graphs in either Python or R. The major models, and even some of the smaller ones are great with the finicky details like axis labels, colors, etc. in packages like GGPlot, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and many others. The models can respond to requests where you know exactly what you want, e.g. “change the y-axis to a log scale”, but also do well when you just have a visual sense of what you want but not the details e.g. “Jitter the data points a little bit, but not too much, and make the whole thing more compact”.</p><p id="1b1a" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nz oa fq ob b go oc od oe gr of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou fj bk">Does the above require spatial reasoning? Arguably not. To push further I decided to test the models by giving it just a dataset and a visual message that I wanted to convey with the data, and no instructions about what type of visualization to choose or how to show it. GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet both did pretty well. GPT-4 initially misinterpreted the data so required a couple of iterations; Claude’s solution worked right away and got better with some tweaking. Final code with a link to the data are in this <a class="af pa" href="https://github.com/nathanbos/blog_spatial_reasoning/blob/main/Michigan_Ohio_State_data_visualizations.ipynb" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Google Colab notebook</a> on Github.

LLMs are still very language-centric. The overall result was not effective, however. The LLM could not ‘see’ that the block of red on the left side is much more visually prominent than the small labels on the right.</p><h1 id="a5ff" class="mj mk fq bf ml mm mn gq mo mp mq gt mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne bk">Already Quite Good: Object Recognition</h1><p id="5681" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nz oa fq ob b go ov od oe gr ow og oh oi ox ok ol om oy oo op oq oz os ot ou fj bk">As noted, there has been a lot of research on AI use of photo imagery, and LLMs are being paired with models specializing in things like object recognition.

Here’s a brief description of each and their typical uses:</p><p id="8c05" class="nz oa pf ob b go oc od oe gr of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou fj bk">1. **Bolt Cutters (top left)**: These are typically used for cutting through heavy materials such as chains, padlocks, bolts, and wire mesh. They have long handles and a pair of sharp blades designed to apply significant force to cut through tough materials.</p><p id="49d1" class="nz oa pf ob b go oc od oe gr of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou fj bk">2. **Utility Knife (top right)**: This knife is versatile and can be used for cutting various materials, such as cardboard, plastic, and other light to medium-density materials. It usually has a retractable blade for safety.</p><p id="54c5" class="nz oa pf ob b go oc od oe gr of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou fj bk">3. **Locking Pliers/Vice Grips (middle)**: These pliers are used for gripping objects tightly. They can be locked into place, allowing for hands-free operation. They’re useful for holding materials securely, turning objects, or even as a makeshift clamp.</p><p id="ee71" class="nz oa pf ob b go oc od oe gr of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou fj bk">4. **Diagonal Cutters/Wire Cutters (middle left)**: These pliers are used for cutting wires and small pins in areas that are hard to reach. The cutting edges are offset by about 15 degrees, which allows for precision cuts.</p><p id="7a60" class="nz oa pf ob b go oc od oe gr of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou fj bk">5. **Tin Snips (bottom right)**: These are used for cutting sheet metal and other tough materials. The yellow handles often indicate that they are designed for straight cuts. They’re ideal for cutting through aluminum, steel, and other metal sheets.</p><p id="afbc" class="nz oa pf ob b go oc od oe gr of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou fj bk">These tools are essential in various trades and DIY projects, providing functionality from cutting and gripping to clamping and precise material manipulation.</p></blockquote><p id="f89b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nz oa fq ob b go oc od oe gr of og oh oi oj ok ol om on oo op oq or os ot ou fj bk">These are all correct and this level of information would be helpful to a non-expert DIY practitioner like myself.</p><h1 id="6f8d" class="mj mk fq bf ml mm mn gq mo mp mq gt mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne bk">Conclusions</h1><p id="02fe" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nz oa fq ob b go ov od oe gr ow og oh oi ox ok ol om oy oo op oq oz os ot ou fj bk">Major LLM models are improving on a range of spatial problems, but even with help are a long ways from human-level spatial reasoning capabilities.
