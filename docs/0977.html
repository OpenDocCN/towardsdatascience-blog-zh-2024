first person to sit down and really think about what the advent of AI means for our world, but it’s a question that I still find being asked and talked about. However, I think most of these conversations seem to miss key factors.</p><p id="a840" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Before I begin, let me give you three anecdotes that illustrate different aspects of this issue that have shaped my thinking lately.</p><ol class=""><li id="28c7" class="nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob bk">I had a conversation with my financial advisor recently. He remarked that the executives at his institution were disseminating the advice that AI is a substantive change in the economic scene, and that investing strategies should regard it as revolutionary, not just a hype cycle or a flash in the pan. He wanted to know what I thought, as a practitioner in the machine learning industry. I told him, as I’ve said before to friends and readers, that there’s a lot of overblown hype, and we’re still waiting to see what’s real under all of that. The hype cycle is still happening.</li><li id="447e" class="nd ne fq nf b go oc nh ni gr od nk nl nm oe no np nq of ns nt nu og nw nx ny nz oa ob bk">Also this week, I listened to the episode of <a class="af nc" href="https://www.techwontsave.us/episode/216_kara_swisher_shows_tech_journalisms_flaws_w_edward_ongweso_jr" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Tech Won’t Save Us about tech journalism and Kara Swisher.</a> Guest Edward Ongweso Jr. remarked that he thought Swisher has a pattern of being credulous about new technologies in the moment and changing tune after those new technologies prove not to be as impressive or revolutionary as they promised (see, self-driving cars and cryptocurrency). He thought that this phenomenon was happening with her again, this time with AI.</li><li id="a5e8" class="nd ne fq nf b go oc nh ni gr od nk nl nm oe no np nq of ns nt nu og nw nx ny nz oa ob bk">My partner and I both work in tech, and regularly discuss tech news. He remarked once about a phenomenon where you think that a particular pundit or tech thinker has very wise insights when the topic they are discussing is one you don’t know a lot about, but when they start talking about something that’s in your area of expertise, suddenly you realize that they’re very off base. You go back in your mind and wonder, “I know they’re wrong about this. Were they also wrong about those other things?” I’ve been experiencing this from time to time recently on the subject of machine learning.</li></ol><p id="86af" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">It’s really hard to know <a class="af nc" href="https://www.vox.com/2015/2/26/8114391/inventions-dumb-fads" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">how new technologies are going to settle</a> and what their <a class="af nc" href="https://www.vox.com/2015/2/9/8004661/fads-inventions-changed-world" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">long term impact will be</a> on our society. Historians will tell you that it’s easy to look back and assume “this is the only way that events could have panned out”, but in reality, in the moment no one knew what was going to happen next, and there were myriad possible turns of events that could have changed the whole outcome, equally or more likely than what finally happened.</p><h1 id="5058" class="oh oi fq bf oj ok ol gq om on oo gt op oq or os ot ou ov ow ox oy oz pa pb pc bk">TL;DR</h1><p id="1314" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go pd nh ni gr pe nk nl nm pf no np nq pg ns nt nu ph nw nx ny fj bk">AI is not a total scam.

And, AGI is not a realistic prospect.</p><blockquote class="pj"><p id="333f" class="pk pl fq bf pm pn po pp pq pr ps ny dx">AI is not a total scam. … AI is <em class="pt">also</em> not going to change everything about our world and our economy.</p></blockquote><p id="5fae" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go pu nh ni gr pv nk nl nm pw no np nq px ns nt nu py nw nx ny fj bk">Why do I say this? Let me explain.</p><p id="08de" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">First, I want to say that machine learning is pretty great. I think that teaching computers to parse the nuances of patterns that are too complex for people to really grok themselves is fascinating, and that it creates loads of opportunities for computers to solve problems. Machine learning is already influencing our lives in all kinds of ways, and has been doing so for years. When I build a model that can complete a task that would be tedious or nearly impossible for a person, and it is deployed so that a problem for my colleagues is solved, that’s very satisfying. This is a very small scale version of some of the cutting edge things being done in generative AI space, but it’s in the same broad umbrella.</p><h1 id="cd4e" class="oh oi fq bf oj ok ol gq om on oo gt op oq or os ot ou ov ow ox oy oz pa pb pc bk">Expectations</h1><p id="bd34" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go pd nh ni gr pe nk nl nm pf no np nq pg ns nt nu ph nw nx ny fj bk">Speaking to laypeople and speaking to machine learning practitioners will get you very different pictures of what AI is expected to mean. I’ve written about this before, but it bears some repeating. What do we expect AI to do for us? What do we mean when we use the term “artificial intelligence”?</p><p id="a853" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk"><strong class="nf fr">To me, AI is basically “automating tasks using machine learning models”. That’s it.</strong> If the ML model is very complex, it might enable us to automate some complicated tasks, but even little models that do relatively narrow tasks are still part of the mix. I’ve written at length about what a machine learning model really does, but for shorthand: mathematically parse and replicate patterns from data. So that means we’re automating tasks using mathematical representations of patterns. AI is us choosing what to do next based on the patterns of events from recorded history, whether that’s the history of texts people have written, the history of house prices, or anything else.</p><blockquote class="pj"><p id="fe62" class="pk pl fq bf pm pn po pp pq pr ps ny dx">AI is us choosing what to do next based on the patterns of events from recorded history, whether that’s the history of texts people have written, the history of house prices, or anything else.</p></blockquote><p id="395b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go pu nh ni gr pv nk nl nm pw no np nq px ns nt nu py nw nx ny fj bk">However, to many folks, AI means something far more complex, on the level of being vaguely sci-fi. In some cases, they blur the line between AI and AGI, which is poorly defined in our discourse as well. Often I don’t think people themselves know what they mean by these terms, but I get the sense that they expect something far more sophisticated and universal than what reality has to offer.</p><p id="6d65" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">For example, LLMs understand the syntax and grammar of human language, but have no inherent concept of the tangible meanings. Everything an LLM knows is internally referential — “king” to an LLM is defined only by its relationships to other words, like “queen” or “man”. So if we need a model to help us with linguistic or semantic problems, that’s perfectly fine. Ask it for synonyms, or even to accumulate paragraphs full of words related to a particular theme that sound very realistically human, and it’ll do great.</p><p id="df46" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">But there is a stark difference between this and “knowledge”. Throw a rock and you’ll find a social media thread of people ridiculing how ChatGPT doesn’t get facts right, and hallucinates all the time. ChatGPT is not and will never be a “facts producing robot”; it’s a large language model. It does language. Knowledge is even one step beyond facts, where the entity in question has <em class="pi">understanding</em> of what the facts mean and more. We are not at any risk of machine learning models getting to this point, what some people would call “AGI”, using the current methodologies and techniques available to us.</p><blockquote class="pj"><p id="49d7" class="pk pl fq bf pm pn po pp pq pr ps ny dx">Knowledge is even one step beyond facts, where the entity in question has <em class="pt">understanding</em> of what the facts mean and more.

This might be interesting, but hardly an epiphany. This is a machine learning model as a tool to help people do their jobs a bit better. It allows us to automate small things and reduce human work a bit, as I’ve mentioned. This is not unique to the generative AI world, however! We’ve been automating tasks and reducing human labor with machine learning for over a decade, and adding LLMs to the mix is a difference of degrees, not a seismic shift.</p><blockquote class="pj"><p id="593f" class="pk pl fq bf pm pn po pp pq pr ps ny dx">We’ve been automating tasks and reducing human labor with machine learning for over a decade, and adding LLMs to the mix is a difference of degrees, not a seismic shift.</p></blockquote><p id="bc84" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go pu nh ni gr pv nk nl nm pw no np nq px ns nt nu py nw nx ny fj bk">I mean to say that using machine learning can and does definitely provide us incremental improvements in the speed and efficiency by which we can do lots of things, but our expectations should be shaped by real comprehension of what these models are and what they are not.</p><h1 id="3cf4" class="oh oi fq bf oj ok ol gq om on oo gt op oq or os ot ou ov ow ox oy oz pa pb pc bk">Practical Limits</h1><p id="f6a7" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go pd nh ni gr pe nk nl nm pf no np nq pg ns nt nu ph nw nx ny fj bk">You may be thinking that my first argument is based on the current technological capabilities for training models, and the methods being used today, and that’s a fair point.

With infinite resources (money, electricity, rare earth metals for chips, human-generated content for training, etc), there’s one level of pattern representation that we could get from machine learning. However, with the real world in which we live, all of these resources are quite finite and we’re already coming up against some of their limits.</p><blockquote class="pj"><p id="bf20" class="pk pl fq bf pm pn po pp pq pr ps ny dx">The potential for machine learning to support solutions to problems is very different from our ability to realize that potential.</p></blockquote><p id="91d3" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go pu nh ni gr pv nk nl nm pw no np nq px ns nt nu py nw nx ny fj bk">We’ve known for years already that <a class="af nc" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/11/24/1063684/we-could-run-out-of-data-to-train-ai-language-programs/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">quality data to train LLMs on is running low</a>, and attempts to reuse generated data as training data <a class="af nc" href="https://futurism.com/ai-trained-ai-generated-data-interview" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">prove very problematic</a>.

As I mentioned, what the popular culture calls AI is really just “automating tasks using machine learning models”, which doesn’t sound nearly as glamorous. Importantly, it reveals that this work is not a monolith, as well. AI isn’t one thing, it’s a million little models all over the place being slotted in to workflows and pipelines we use to complete tasks, all of which require resources to build, integrate, and maintain. We’re adding LLMs as potential choices to slot in to those workflows, but it doesn’t make the process different.</p><p id="ef84" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">As someone with experience doing the work to get business buy-in, resources, and time to build those models, it is not as simple as “can we do it?”. The real question is “is this the right thing to do in the face of competing priorities and limited resources?” Often, building a model and implementing it to automate a task is not the most valuable way to spend company time and money, and projects will be sidelined.</p><h1 id="8367" class="oh oi fq bf oj ok ol gq om on oo gt op oq or os ot ou ov ow ox oy oz pa pb pc bk">Conclusion</h1><p id="6281" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go pd nh ni gr pe nk nl nm pf no np nq pg ns nt nu ph nw nx ny fj bk">Machine learning and its results are awesome, and they offer great potential to solve problems and improve human lives if used well. This is not new, however, and there’s no free lunch. Increasing the implementation of machine learning across sectors of our society is probably going to continue to happen, just like it has been for the past decade or more. Adding generative AI to the toolbox is just a difference of degree.</p><p id="d2c7" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">AGI is a completely different and also entirely imaginary entity at this point. I haven’t even scratched the surface of <em class="pi">whether</em> we would want AGI to exist, even if it could, but I think that’s just an interesting philosophical topic, not an emergent threat. (A topic for another day.) But when someone tells me that they think AI is going to completely change our world, especially in the immediate future, this is why I’m skeptical. Machine learning can help us a great deal, and has been doing so for many years. New techniques, such as those used for developing generative AI, are interesting and useful in some cases, but not nearly as profound a change as we’re being led to believe.</p></div></div></div><div class="ab cb qc qd qe qf" role="separator"><span class="qg by bm qh qi qj"/><span class="qg by bm qh qi qj"/><span class="qg by bm qh qi"/></div><div class="fj fk fl fm fn"><div class="ab cb"><div class="ci bh ev ew ex ey"><p id="aa93" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk"><em class="pi">See more of my work at </em><a class="af nc" href="http://www.stephaniekirmer.com." rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><em class="pi">www.stephaniekirmer.com.</em></a></p><h1 id="b26b" class="oh oi fq bf oj ok ol gq om on oo gt op oq or os ot ou ov ow ox oy oz pa pb pc bk">References</h1><div class="qk ql qm qn qo qp"><a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/2/26/8114391/inventions-dumb-fads?source=post_page-----16ed5b6877aa--------------------------------" rel="noopener  ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><div class="qq ab ig"><div class="qr ab co cb qs qt"><h2 class="bf fr hw z io qu iq ir qv it iv fp bk">These 7 inventions were supposed to change the world.
