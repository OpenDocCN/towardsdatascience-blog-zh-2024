    the gap between engineering and analytics. Engineering and analytics are often
    siloed into their own teams, making cross-collaboration quite difficult.

    Analytics is then forced to pivot its work to accommodate these changes. Or worse,
    analytics must suggest a change that engineering needs to then fight into their
    tight schedule.
