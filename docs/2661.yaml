- en: When I began working on my Master’s thesis titled “Factors Associated with Impactful
    Scientific Publications in NIH-Funded Heart Disease Research,” the first task
    was to build an original dataset to study. To achieve this, I turned to PubMed,
    a free research database provided by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) for
    accessing biomedical literature.

- en: Two limiting factors, the availability of the first author’s full name and the
    years required for citations to occur, were used to choose the time period for
    data gathering. PubMed records started to include full author’s names, Full Author
    (FAU), for articles starting in 2002 [1]. In addition, three years is the minimum
    number of years recommended for citation and publication impact analysis [2].
    To maximize the dataset size, a minimum time frame of two years for citations
    accumulation was applied, as the dataset was constructed in 2022\. Furthermore,
    2020 is the last year for which the Scientific Journal Ranking (SJR) information
    needed for data analysis was available at the time of dataset creation [3]. As
    a result, I searched PubMed for records from 2002 to 2020, creating a total of
    18 datasets — one for each year. The overview of the limiting factors is shown
    in the flowchart below.

- en: I used PubMed’s advanced search tool [4] to construct datasets of publications
    on cardiovascular disease. PubMed data element (field) descriptions [1] were used
    to make query calls. NIH funding is represented by National Heart, Lung, and Blood
    Institute (NHLBI) grant funding. I used the NHLBI grant ([GR]), the Date of Publication
    ([DP]) keywords in queries, along with the combination of keywords that are based
    on the cardiovascular disease-related conditions. Those keywords are cardiovascular,
    ischemic, and heart.

    the abstract format option in the display options menu and the PubMed format in
    the save citations to the file menu.

- en: To acquire the citation-related information and full unabbreviated names of
    the authors when available, I uploaded the PMIDs dataset for each year to the
    ICite web tool [5]. I saved the resulting data analysis as csv files. ICite is
    run by the Office of Portfolio Analysis (OPA). The OPA is a division of the NIH
    that is responsible for the data-driven evaluation of research to help the NIH
    decide what current or new research areas will have a greater benefit for science
    and human health. ICite provides available information on the author’s full first
    name, total citations, citations per year, a field- and time-adjusted citation
    measure of scientific influence called Relative Citation Ratio (RCR), and NIH
    Percentile.

- en: The PubMed format datasets cannot be saved in a CSV format and therefore had
    to be parsed to extract Journal Title (JT), first Author Institution Affiliation
    (AD), and country. I wrote a parsing script in Python 3.10.1 for these purposes.
    This article will not go into the details of the script, but I plan to cover them
    in a future publication. First author affiliation was determined by making an
    Application Programming Interface (API) request to the Research Organization Registry
    (ROR) API [5]. ROR matching was necessary because Data Element field provided
    inconsistent names for the research institutions along with unnecessary information
    such as address and department name. ROR affiliation matching allows to find research
    organizations mentioned in the full affiliation strings from the PubMed format
    datasets which are then provided in the API call. The results of the API call
    are returned in the JSON format. I parsed journal titles and countries from the
    PubMed format datasets using PubMed Data Element (Field) Descriptions included
    in this type of file format. I processed the dataset for each year separately.
    Bellow is the example of the PubMed format file entry.

- en: I processed the parsed PubMed format datasets for each year queried in a JupyterLab
    and merged them on PMIDs with ICite citation datasets. I merged the resulting
    datasets for each year based on journal names with the SJR dataset. I downloaded
    the SJR dataset for the last available year, 2020, from the SCImago Journal &
    Country Rank website [3]. The SCImago Journal & Country Rank database ranking
    is based on the SJR indicator. The SJR indicator was developed from the information
    contained in the Scopus® database and is a measure of a journal’s scientific impact.
