    in machine learning. Whether you’re choosing the right model for your application,
    looking for a general knowledge of the field, or following discussions about LLMs
    and their potential to *understand*, *create*, or lead to AGI, the first step
    is **understanding what they are**.

    I found most helpful in learning about the fundamentals of LLMs in about 14 days,
    and how you can do this in a relatively short time. This roadmap could help you
    learn almost all the essentials:'
