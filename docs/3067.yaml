    than ever. Even though public reports claim that the [job demand](https://365datascience.com/career-advice/career-guides/machine-learning-engineer-skills/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=linktree&utm_campaign=linktree-machine-learning-engineer-job-market&utm_content=post#h_56513925515981716376290404)
    for machine learning engineers (MLE) is fast growing, the fact is that the market
    has turned toward an employer’s market over the past few years. Finding an ML
    job in 2020, 2022, and 2024 could be completely different experiences. What’s
    more, a few factors contribute to the disparities of job-seeking difficulties
    across geography, domain, as well as seniority level:'

- en: '**Geography**: According to the [People in AI report](https://www.peopleinai.com/blog/2024-job-market-for-machine-learning-engineers),
    the top cities *hiring* in North America in 2024 are the Bay Area, NYC, Seattle,
    etc. If we use the ratio between professionals# and post# to evaluate the success
    rate of finding a job, then the success rate in the Bay Area is 3.6%. However,
    if you live in LA or Toronto, the demand is much lower, which causes the success
    rate to drop to 1.4%, only 40% compared to the Bay Area. The success rate could
    be even lower if you live in other cities.'

    domain. Take deep learning models as an example; CV usually uses models like ResNet,
    Yolo, etc., while NLP involves understanding RNN, LSTM, GRU, and Transformers;
    Fraud Detection uses SpinalNet; LLM focuses on the knowledge of Llama and GPT;
    Recommendation System consists of the understanding of Word2Vec and Item2Vec.
    However, not all domains are hiring the same number of ML Engineers. If we search
    the tags in the [system design case studies from Evidently AI](https://www.evidentlyai.com/ml-system-design),
    the tag CV corresponds to 30 use cases, Fraud Detection corresponds to 29, NLP
    corresponds to 48, LLM corresponds to 81 and Recommendation System corresponds
    to 82\. The Recommendation System has almost 2.7 times more use cases than the
    CV. This ratio might be highly biased and not truly reflect the actual situation
    in the job market. Still, it shows the likelihood of more opportunities in the
    Recommendation System for ML Engineers.'

    although 72% of the postings don’t explicitly state the YOE required, engineers
    with 2–4 YOE are in the highest demand. This means you’ll likely face more difficulty
    getting an entry-level job offer. (The reason that most demand is on engineers
    with 2–4 YOE could be explained by the fact that MLE was not a typical role five
    years ago, [as explained in this blog post](https://blog.qwasar.io/blog/why-its-so-difficult-to-find-senior-machine-learning-engineers).)'

    could come under different names, such as machine learning engineer, machine learning
    scientist, deep learning engineer, machine learning developer, applied machine
    learning scientist, data scientist, etc. At the end of the day, **a typical machine
    learning engineer role is end-to-end**, which means you’ll start by talking to
    product managers (sometimes to customers) and defining the ML problem, preparing
    the dataset, designing and training the model, defining the evaluation metrics,
    and serving and scaling the model, and keeping improving the outcome. Sometimes,
    companies mix the titles, e.g., MLE with ML Ops. It’s the responsibilities that
    matter, not the titles.'

    discusses the differences between application and tooling companies, large companies
    and startups, and B2B and B2C companies. Moreover, it’s worth considering whether
    the company is public or private, whether it’s sales-driven or product-oriented.
    These concepts should not be overlooked, especially if you’re looking for your
    first industry job, as they will build your “lens of career,” which we’ll discuss
    later in the interview strategy section.'

    fall into different domains like recommendation systems and LLMs, and you need
    to spend time preparing for the fundamental knowledge. You need to identify one
    or two domains you’re most interested in to maximize your chances; however, preparing
    for all different domains is almost impossible as it will disperse your energy
    and attention and get you under-prepared.'

    for MLE jobs will be even more difficult unless you live in high-demand areas
    like the Bay Area or NYC. If relocating is impossible, you probably need to plan
    for a longer timeline to get a satisfying job offer; however, if you leave the
    relocating option open, applying to opportunities in high-demanding areas is probably
    a good idea.'

- en: The interview format varies among different companies. No two companies have
    the same interview format for the MLE role, so you must do your “homework” on
    researching the format in advance. For example, even for FAANG companies, Apple
    is known for its startup-style interview format, which varies from team to team.
    On the other hand, Meta tends to have a consistent interview format at the company
    level, comprising one or two leet code rounds and ML system design rounds. Usually,
    the recruiter would give detailed information about large companies' interview
    format, so you won’t be surprised. However, the process could be less structured
    for smaller companies and change more frequently. Sometimes, smaller companies
    replace leet code with other coding questions and only lightly touch the modelling
    part instead of having an entire ML system design session. You should search for
    information on free websites like Prepfully, Glassdoor, Interview Query, or other
    paid websites for a comprehensive understanding of the interview format and process
    to prepare better in advance. Lastly, **don’t be limited by interview format**
    as it’s not a standard test — there could be behaviour elements during technical
    interviews and technical questions during your hiring manager round. **Be prepared,
    but be flexible and ready to be surprised.**

- en: Many web articles would exaggerate the benefit of referrals, but having a referral
    is just a shorter path for you to get past the recruiter round and land directly
    to the second round (usually the hiring manager round). Besides having referrals,
    it’s almost equivalently essential to network in person, e.g., use hackathon opportunities
    to talk to companies, go to in-person job fairs, and participate in offline volunteer
    events sponsored by companies you’re interested in. Please don’t *rely on referrals
    or networking to get a job, but use them as opportunities to increase your probability
    of getting more conversations from recruiters and hiring managers to maximize
    your interview efficiency*.

    that help recruiters understand who you are beyond the textual information in

    challenges in your GitHub repository to show more relevant experience; however,
    at you get more senior level, toy projects make less sense, but PR in large-scale
    open source projects, insightful articles and analysis, tutorials on SOTA research
    or toolboxes, will make you stand out from the rest of the candidates.'

- en: Planning, tracking, and evolving. Ideally, [as described in this article](https://acompa.net/mle-job-hunt-2024.html),
    you should get at least a handful of recruiter calls and categorize your interviews
    to different interest levels. For one thing, the job market is constantly changing,
    and someone can rarely plan for the best strategy in the first interview. For
    the other thing, you’ll learn and grow during the interview process, so you’ll
    become different from where you were a few months ago at the beginning of the
    job-seeking stage. So, even if you’re the most talented candidate on the market,
    it’s essential to spread out your conversations over a few months and **start
    with the conversations that you’re least interested in** to familiarize yourself
    with the market and sharpen your interview skills, and leave the most important
    ones to the later stage. **Track your progress, feedback, and thoughts** during
    your interview process. **Set specific learning goals and evolve with your interviews.**
    You might never have had the chance to touch on GenAI knowledge in the past few
    years, but you could utilize the interview process to learn from online courses
    and build small side projects. **The best thing is to get a job after the interview,
    and the second best thing is to learn something useful even if you don’t get the
    job offer.** If you keep learning from every interview, eventually, it will vastly
    increase your chances of getting the next job offer.
  prefs: []

- en: Prompting. This is the age of LLM, and you should utilize it wisely. Look for
    the keywords in the job descriptions or responsibilities. If there is an interview
    involving “software engineering principles,” then you can prompt your favourite
    LLM to give you a list of software engineering principles for machine learning
    for preparation purposes. Again, the prompt answer shouldn’t be your sole source
    of knowledge, but it can compensate for some blind spots from your daily reading
    sources.

    Unless you’re an absolute beginner in this field, you can always try the opportunities
    that are one level above and prepare for the down level at the job offer stage.
    If you’re interviewing for senior level, preparing or applying to staff-level
    opportunities doesn't hurt. It doesn’t always work, but sometimes it can open
    doors for you.

    about your career. Unless you desperately need this job for a specific reason,
    ask yourself, **where does this job fit into your overall career map**? This question
    matters from two perspectives: first, it helps you choose the company that you
    want to go to, e.g., one startup might offer higher salaries in the short run,
    but if it doesn’t prioritize sound software engineering principles, then you’ll
    lose the opportunity to grow into a promising career in the long run; second,
    it helps to diagnose the outcome of the interview, e.g., your rejections are mostly
    from startups, but eventually you landed in offers from well-known listed companies,
    then you’ll realize the rejections don’t mean you’re not a qualified MLE, but
    because interviewing at startups require different skills and those don’t belong
    to your career path.'

    partner. But these days, there are interview services all over the internet ranging
    from extremely high cost (which I don’t recommend) to a few hundred dollars. Remember,
    it’s a constantly shifting market, so nobody knows the whole picture. The best
    way to gain information is to partner with your non-competitive peers (e.g., you’re
    in the CV domain, and your partner is in the recommendation system domain) to
    practice and improve together. Better than just partnering, **you should seek
    to partner up — look for people with a higher seniority level while you can still
    offer something useful for them**. You might ask, how is it possible? Why would
    someone more senior than me want to practice with me together? Remember, nobody
    is perfect, and you can consistently offer others something. There are senior
    software engineers who would like to become MLE, and you can trade your ML knowledge
    for their software engineering best practices. There are product managers who
    need ML-related input, and you can ask for behavioural practice in return. Even
    for people with no industry experience at the entry-level, you can still ask for
    coding practice in return or listen to their life stories and get inspired. As
    an MLE, especially at the senior/staff level, you need to demonstrate leadership
    skills, and the best leadership skill you can demonstrate is to collect the professionals
    at different levels to help achieve the goal you’re chasing after — your dream
    offer.

    the interviews, are explicit. However, some red flags are more subtle or deliberately
    disguised. For example, your hiring manager might politely explain their situation
    and wish you “didn’t have high expectations at the beginning and decide to leave
    in a few months” — it sounds so considerate. Still, it shadows the fact that the
    turnover is high. The best strategy for avoiding red flags involves reading Glassdoor
    reviews and learning about company culture during the interview. Specifically,
    “culture” doesn’t mean the “culture claims” defined on the company website but
    the actual dynamics between you and the team. Are the interviewers only asking
    prepared questions without trying to understand your problem-solving skills? When
    you throw a question, can the interviewer catch that question and give an answer
    that helps you to understand the company’s value better? Lastly, **always remember
    to use your gut feelings and decide whether you like your future team**. After
    all, if you decide to take the job offer, you’re facing these people eight hours
    per day for the next few years; if your gut feeling tells you that you don’t like
    them, then it won’t be happy anyway.

    but you also gained a lot of things from the journey! Now you’re relaxed and happy,
    and it’s the best opportunity to reflect, be grateful to the people who helped
    you during the interview, and share some of the information with those still struggling
    with their interview process. Besides, you must have collected a lot of notes
    and to-do lists during the past few months but never had time to sit down and
    organize them, and now is the best opportunity to do that!'

    the past few months; now, you’ve better understood your learning ability and problem-solving
    ability under pressure. You have talked to so many startups and big techs and
    start to have a better picture of where you are in the next five years. If you’re
    at the mid-to-senior level, then you have probably talked to many people at the
    staff level and gotten a better idea of what you will work on in the next stage
    of your career. This is the time for all this planning!'

    to reading papers and learning about SOTA ML techniques. However, the role of
    MLE is more than that of the academy. It combines research, applied ML practices
    and software engineering to make a real business impact. Now is a good time to
    think about the best strategy to keep learning from multiple sources to keep yourself
    up-to-date.'

    company and know what models or tech stack they’re using. In sporadic cases, you
    already know this tech stack very well, but most times, you need to learn many
    new things for the new role. Make a plan for how you will learn them and set small
    milestones to achieve the goals. Besides, learn about your new company, explore
    its homepage and understand its business goals. this will help to set a good tone
    when you start the new job and talk to your new colleagues.'
