- en: I live only a couple hours’ drive from the path of totality for this year’s
    eclipse, and it drives me crazy when people say that they’re staying home because
    “95% of the sun will be covered and that’s good enough.”

- en: I can assure you it is ***not*** good enough. Not by a long shot. I saw totality
    in 2017 and, while I won’t call it “life changing,” it was definitely one of the
    great events of my life.

    95% of the sun is occluded — even accounting for [limb darkening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limb_darkening)
    — it’s still over 7,000 times brighter than the moon! That’s the same brightness
    as an overcast day.'

    dilate to keep up with the waning light. For most of the eclipse, you can’t even
    tell it’s happening.

    day. The temperature plummets. People gasp in awe. Birds stop singing. Your neck
    hairs stand on…
