But what are a tribunal’s methods for performing that task? How many methods does a tribunal employ? There are at least three stages typical for any type of fact-finding institution.</p><p id="fb0b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">First, a trier of fact must determine which items of available evidence are relevant for deciding which issues of fact. An item of evidence is relevant to proving a factual proposition if it tends to make that proposition more or less probable than it would be without that evidence.</p><p id="5fe6" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Second, for each issue and set of relevant evidence, a trier of fact must evaluate the trustworthiness of each item of evidence. A person might use various criteria to evaluate the credibility of a witness’s testimony, or the trustworthiness of a document’s contents, or the probative value of a piece of physical evidence. It would be useful to determine which factors a tribunal tends to use in evaluating the credibility or trustworthiness of a particular piece of evidence. Also, can we determine priorities among those factors?</p><p id="7ee4" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Third, a trier of fact needs to weigh competing evidence. A person needs to balance inconsistent but credible evidence, and then determine the net probative value of all the relevant evidence. There might be different approaches to resolving conflicts between the testimonies of two different witnesses, or of the same witness over time. Or there may be different methods for deciding between statements within different documents, or between testimony and written statements. Can we determine patterns or “soft rules” for doing such comparisons?</p><p id="889d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">A particular type of sentence found in legal decisions provides important clues about the answers to such questions. A well-written legal decision expressly states at least some of the decision maker’s chains of intermediate inferences. Of particular importance are the sentences that state its evidential reasoning — which I will call “reasoning sentences.”</p><p id="24f0" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">In this article, I discuss the distinguishing characteristics and usefulness of such reasoning sentences. I also discuss the linguistic features that make it possible for machine-learning (ML) models to automatically label reasoning sentences within legal decision documents. I discuss why the adequacy of the performance of those models depends upon the use case, and why even basic ML models can be suitable for the task. I conclude by positioning reasoning sentences within the broader task of using generative AI and large language models to address <a class="af nc" rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="/7-challenges-for-argument-mining-in-law-fb98a6df7b0c">the challenges of argument mining</a>.</p></div></div></div><div class="ab cb nz oa ob oc" role="separator"><span class="od by bm oe of og"/><span class="od by bm oe of og"/><span class="od by bm oe of"/></div><div class="fj fk fl fm fn"><div class="ab cb"><div class="ci bh ev ew ex ey"><p id="cd4d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk"><strong class="nf fr">The Characteristics and Usefulness of Reasoning Sentences</strong></p><p id="754d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">In a fact-finding legal decision, a statement of the evidential reasoning explains how the evidence and legal rules support the findings of fact. A reasoning sentence, therefore, is a statement by the tribunal describing some part of the reasoning behind those findings of fact. An example is the following sentence from a fact-finding decision by the <a class="af nc" href="https://www.bva.va.gov/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Board of Veterans’ Appeals</a> (BVA) in a claim for benefits for a service-related disability:</p><p id="89d7" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk"><em class="oh">Also, the clinician’s etiological opinions are credible based on their internal consistency and her duty to provide truthful opinions.</em></p><p id="b99f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">In other articles, I have discussed <a class="af nc" href="https://medium.com/towards-data-science/the-evidence-is-critical-for-classifying-legal-cases-36c1dd6cfd04" rel="noopener">evidence sentences</a>, <a class="af nc" rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="/legal-rules-structure-the-reasoning-in-legal-documents-fbd59c67a17b">legal-rule sentences</a>, and <a class="af nc" rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="/conclusions-as-anchors-for-mining-legal-reasoning-6f837fb8da3c">finding sentences</a>. In inferential terms, the evidence and legal rules function as premises, and the finding of fact functions as a conclusion. You can consider reasoning sentences as premises also, in the sense that they explain the probative value of the evidence.</p><p id="ab4d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">For attorneys and parties involved in a case, reasoning sentences provide an official explanation of why a party’s argument based on the evidence was successful or not. The parties are entitled to hold the tribunal to its stated reasons. Attorneys for the parties can use those stated reasons to help develop arguments against the logic used by the tribunal, or to develop additional support for that logic.

Nevertheless, trained models can still provide useful predictions about sentence type. <a class="af nc" href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2385/paper1.pdf" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">We trained a Logistic Regression model</a> on a dataset of 50 BVA decisions created by <a class="af nc" href="https://www.lltlab.org/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Hofstra Law’s Law, Logic &amp; Technology Research Laboratory (LLT Lab)</a>. That dataset contains 5,797 manually labeled sentences after preprocessing, 710 of which are reasoning sentences. In a multi-class scenario, the model classified reasoning sentences with precision = 0.66 and recall = 0.52. We got comparable results with a neural network (“NN”) model that we later trained on the same BVA dataset, and we tested on 1,846 sentences.

The prediction scores for the possible sentence roles (shown below the sentence text) show that the NN model erroneously predicted this to be an evidence sentence (score = 45.01%), although reasoning sentence also received a relatively high score (33.01%).</p><p id="d678" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">In fact, the wording of sentences can make their true classification highly ambiguous, even for lawyers. An example is whether to classify the following sentence as a legal-rule sentence or as a reasoning sentence:</p><p id="0182" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk"><em class="oh">No further development or corroborative evidence is required, provided that the claimed stressor is “consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran’s service.”</em></p><p id="fb59" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Given the immediate context within the decision, we manually labeled this sentence as stating a legal rule about when further development or corroborative evidence is required. But the sentence also contains wording consistent with a trier of fact’s reasoning within the specifics of a case. Based only on the sentence wording, however, even lawyers might reasonably classify this sentence in either category.</p><p id="8529" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">The cost of a classification error depends upon the use case and the type of error. For the purpose of extracting and presenting examples of legal reasoning, the precision and recall noted above might be acceptable to a user. A precision of 0.66 means that about 2 of every 3 sentences predicted to be reasoning sentences are correctly predicted, and a recall of 0.51 means that about half of the actual reasoning sentences are correctly detected. If high recall is not essential, and the goal is helpful illustration of past reasoning, such performance might be acceptable.</p><p id="ca15" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">An error might be especially low-cost if it consists of confusing a reasoning sentence with an evidence sentence or legal-rule sentence that still contains insight about the reasoning at work in the case. If the user is interested in viewing different examples of possible arguments, then a sentence classified either as reasoning or evidence or legal rule might still be part of an illustrative argument pattern.</p><p id="8325" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">Such low precision and recall would be unacceptable, however, if the goal is to compile accurate statistics on the occurrence of arguments involving a particular kind of reasoning. Our confidence would be very low for descriptive or inferential statistics based on a sample drawn from a set of decisions in which the reasoning sentences were automatically labeled using such a model.</p></div></div></div><div class="ab cb nz oa ob oc" role="separator"><span class="od by bm oe of og"/><span class="od by bm oe of og"/><span class="od by bm oe of"/></div><div class="fj fk fl fm fn"><div class="ab cb"><div class="ci bh ev ew ex ey"><p id="6aa0" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk"><strong class="nf fr">Summary</strong></p><p id="327b" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">In sum, reasoning sentences can contain extremely valuable information about the types of arguments and reasoning at work in a decision.</p><p id="5aab" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nd ne fq nf b go ng nh ni gr nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny fj bk">First, they signal patterns of reasoning recognized by triers of fact in past cases, and they can suggest possible patterns of argument in future cases.
