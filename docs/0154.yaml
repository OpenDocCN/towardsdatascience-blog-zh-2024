    With the advent of generative AI, the power of data science has been placed squarely
    in the hands of the common consumer. And in turn, generative AI, with its uncanny
    ability to mimic and even surpass human creativity, at least our judgments of
    what creativity is, has become a potent force in the data science landscape.

    in a basement laboratory conducting social-psychophysiological studies of the
    human mind. It’s where I learned to see the social significance of data, the humanity
    behind every data point, and is why I now see something bigger as generative AI
    takes its hold on society.

    text, holds immense promise for streamlining processes and automating tasks. But
    as we increasingly entrust these models with crucial decisions, a chilling reality
    emerges: they may reflect and amplify the very biases woven into the data they
    consume. This stark truth is amplified by a recent experiment I conducted, where
    an AI trained on job candidate profiles…'
