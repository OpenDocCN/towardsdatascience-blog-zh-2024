- en: The development of time series foundation models has been accelerating over
    the last two quarters, and we have been witnessing the release of a new model
    nearly every month. It started with TimeGPT [1] in the last quarter of 2023, and
    since then, we saw the release of Lag-Llama [2], Google releasing TimesFM [3],
    Amazon releasing Chronos [4], and Salesforce releasing Moirai [5].

- en: 'To understand the growing interest in foundation models, we should define their
    core capability: zero-shot inference. It refers to the ability to accurately perform
    tasks or make predictions on data that these models have never encountered during
    their training phase. This ability has been explored for models applied across
    various domains, such as natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and
    multimodal tasks (combining text, images, etc.). The term “zero-shot” comes from
    the idea that the model sees “zero” examples from a specific task or data domain
    during training yet can “shoot” or aim at performing tasks in that area effectively.
    The term was introduced in the paper “Zero-Shot Learning with Semantic Output
    Codes,” authored by Hinton et al. and presented at the NIPS…'
