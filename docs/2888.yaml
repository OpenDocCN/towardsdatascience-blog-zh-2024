- en: In particular, after a brief introduction to the field of network science, I
    am going to list five books which include the foundations of the field as well
    as technical, and even hands-on progamming components. Then, I will move on and
    introduce five frequently used Python tools for network science to lay down the
    practical foundations of your network science journey, and close this selection
    with five tutorials I highly recommend.

- en: Network science may just be called the science of connections. There are hidden
    networks behind any complex system, from society to cities to our nervous systems.
    Network science provides a universal quantitative framework to analyze and understand
    the various patterns in these systems. Today’s network science has found its applications
    in fields ranging from medicine to HR, from multimedia to urban planning, and
    from policy-making to fraud detection.
