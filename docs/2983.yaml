    **unavoidable** work. Why is it unfavored? Dashboarding is less technical (less
    fancy) than analysis and modeling, and more repetitive. But why is it also unavoidable?
    It is the first and must-have step to understand any product, opening the gate
    to analysis and modeling. It even helps build trust with stakeholders as dashboarding
    is usually among the first requests from your stakeholders.

    seen numerous dashboards built by colleagues in the past seven years. Surprisingly,
    not everyone does this ‘easy task’ well. You might be wondering, isn’t dashboarding
    just creating a bunch of charts? Well, Yes and No. To build a good dashboard,
    you need to logically organize each visualization and simplify the complex data
    for your audience. **It is more about data-informed decision-making.** Moreover,
    a good dashboard can always enable self-serve analytics and reduce tedious data
    pull requests, benefitting the data team in return.
