- en: On the morning of Saturday, February 25, 1860, the passenger ship Nimrod pushed
    away from the docks at Liverpool in England. Her destination was the burgeoning
    port of Cork in Ireland — a distance of around 300 miles. Nimrod had plied this
    route dozens of times before as she and hundreds of other boats like her crisscrossed
    the sea between Ireland and England, picking up families from ports in Ireland
    and depositing them at ports in England before their migration to the United States.

- en: Nimrod was a strong, iron-paddled boat powered by steam engines and a full set
    of sails — a modern, powerful, and sea-tested vessel of her era. At her helm was
    captain Lyall — an experienced seaman, an esteemed veteran of the [Crimean war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_War),
    and a gregarious, well-liked leader of the crew. Also on board were 45 souls and
    thousands of pounds worth of cargo. The year 1860 had been an unusually cold and
    wet year but on the weekend of February 25, the seas were calm and there was not
    a storm in sight.
