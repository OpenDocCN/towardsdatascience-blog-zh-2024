- en: Fuzzy logic is an extension of classical logic and makes it possible to deal
    with imprecise and uncertain data. Compared to traditional logic, which is based
    on things being either true or false, fuzzy logic also allows for states in between.
    This means that states can be “partially true” or “somewhat false”.

    and try to use examples that are as simple as possible. We also show the advantages
    and disadvantages of using this method and explain how it differs from traditional
    logic.

- en: Fuzzy logic is an extension of classical Boolean logic which, in addition to
    the two states true/false or 0/1, also allows statements that are only true or
    false to a certain degree and therefore assume a value between 0 and 1\. This
    concept was invented in the 1960s by Lotfi Zadeh at the University of California.
    He tried to solve the problem of teaching a machine to speak human, natural language
    and discovered that language cannot be classified into 0 and 1.
