- en: I’m going to tell a science story, just for fun, because I’m retired, and I
    have time, and it is interesting. It’s not a technical story about how I built
    our [Fishing Maps](https://www.fishingmaps.info) product. It’s about my journey
    from being a fisheries scientist with no interest in industry, to becoming an
    unlikely entrepreneur selling a high tech mapping product to fishers, with a huge
    range of different technical abilities and knowledge. It is not a story about
    wild success, far from it, but it’s not about failure of a startup either. It
    is a tale about fish, which should amuse my colleagues who know that I don’t really
    like fish, even though I’m a fisheries oceanographer (see [Confessions of an Oceanographer](https://smcclatchie.medium.com/confessions-of-an-oceanographer-828fee89b7d6)).
    I’m more of a plankton guy.

- en: When I started out as a brash oceanography grad student in the early 1980s I
    had no interest in working for industry. I thought I’d be a university professor
    (that didn’t happen). When the phone rang in the biological [oceanography lab
    at Dalhousie](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/science/oceanography.html) we used to
    joke that it was [Scripps](https://scripps.ucsd.edu) calling to offer one of us
    a job. That call never came, but we all graduated anyway and went our separate
    ways. My path led me down a long series of postdocs and research associateships,
    and then into “permanent” jobs as a government scientist in New Zealand, Australia
    and California. I did eventually work for 11 years as the NOAA lead for [the CalCOFI
    program](https://calcofi.org), at the [SWFSC](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/southwest-fisheries-science-center)
    on the UCSD Scripps campus in San Diego.

    admiration, how some of my colleagues applied their skills to becoming science
    entrepreneurs. Some were successful, and some were not. One got into remote sensing
    and then into instrument development, becoming very successful quite quickly.
    Another struggled to keep a deep-sea camera business going. Some turned their
    modelling skills from government stock assessment to private consultancy. Others
    set up an acoustic survey company. One developed a tracking system for fish that
    has become famous. Their efforts fascinated me, but the entrepreneurial track
    never appealed. I was too busy writing research papers. It never occurred to me
    that I’d take that path one day.

- en: 'Fast forward 37 years (1985 to 2022). During my career as a fisheries oceanographer
    I learned about three things that fueled entry into entrepreneurship: programming,
    remote sensing, and fishers. When I was a student, spreadsheets on a luggable
    computer were a revelation. I spent so much time looking at a green screen that
    the chalk on a blackboard turned pink. Later on, when I got into fisheries acoustics,
    spreadsheets lost their allure as the data exceeded 10,000 rows and hundreds of
    columns. I had to learn to code my analyses. I’d already written thousands of
    lines of Turbo Pascal to control an experimental system that I designed during
    my first postdoc, so coding wasn’t new to me. It took me a while though. I learned
    R in my 40s, NCL in my 50s and Python in my 60s. I learned the languages the way
    a lot of scientists do, by using them to code analyses for discrete projects that
    led to publications. Eventually I learned to stitch the scripts together using
    shell scripting to create reproducible workflows combining R and Python. I took
    on becoming a Linux user, and worked with open source software. I became an avid
    proponent of open-acess data, open source software, and reproducible open science.'

- en: I’d always been fascinated by satellite remote sensing, which literally exploded
    on the science scene during my career. I quickly went from using a few remote
    sensing images in my papers to requesting data from NASA. I was bemused and excited
    to receive a box of CDs full of data from the [Coastal Zone Color Scanner](https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/czcs/instrument/)
    and later, from other sensors. Handling these data was a puzzle. Each CD had dozens
    of very large files, as HDFs, or some other inscrutable format. What to do with
    it all? My software couldn’t open the files. The CDs sat on my office shelves
    for years, a monument to my frustration. Was NASA really sending CDs to everyone
    who requested data? I didn’t know, but I suspect that they were. I progressed
    to using the different GUIs that NASA and NOAA fielded. They were great for viewing
    a few images, but clumsy for research purposes. I experimented with FTP, but never
    made much much progress until systems were developed to permit the data to be
    accessed, and subset directly from your analysis code without massive download
    redundancy. Accessing remote sensing data became easy, efficient, and scriptable
    using R and Python.

- en: After I moved from plankton research into applied fisheries research, I came
    into contact with fishers and representatives of fishing companies as part of
    my work. I sat through endless planning sessions, stock assessment meetings, and
    program reviews where commercial fishers and upper level industry managers were
    present. I attended meetings where we presented scientific results to fishers,
    NGO representatives and other stakeholders. I realised that commercial fishers
    have a degree of respect for the scientific assessment process, but that they
    are also deeply suspicious of the scientific results. Their views are rooted in
    their experience, and can be difficult to shift in the face of scientific evidence
    that is often incomplete. They often don’t trust the process and resent it when
    the government fisheries managers have the whip hand. Their livelihoods are at
    stake, and that’s a fierce motivator. They sometimes don’t see the government
    scientists as objective, and there are often chronic differences in interpretation
    of evidence concerning status of the stocks. I found the meetings stressful, but
    it did give me some insight into the way that fishers think. That would prove
    useful later when I began selling remote sensing maps to recreational big game
    fishers.

    New Zealand. It was quite liberating not to have to attend meetings, but I couldn’t
    bring myself to leave science behind. I began to learn Python and started toying
    with an idea that I had to make satellite remote sensing maps for recreational
    big game fishers.

- en: There were several false starts and dead ends along the way before I developed
    a robust working product. The idea was to use my oceanographic knowledge create
    maps of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and other ocean variables like chlorophyll
    and currents that could be used to guide sport fishers to locations where they
    would be most likely to catch a marlin or a tuna. The concept changed radically
    along the way. Initially I had planned to sell individual maps for a very small
    fee with the idea that it would be a low value, high volume product. We would
    sell maps online for less than the price of a cup of coffee. This concept failed
    miserably, and proved hard to implement from the technical side as well. I had
    also intended to provide maps for any region of the world, but soon realised that
    this too was problematic, not just in terms of computing time required, but also
    because I wanted to be familiar with the oceanography of the region that we were
    offering maps for. We began to make some headway by offering a package of maps
    for regions focused on the game fishing ports of New Zealand, California and Baja
    California, which are regions that I know well from my work as an oceanographer.

- en: The next challenge was how to become known as a fishing map provider. There
    are established companies already in the market so the challenge was not just
    to become visible, but also to get a market share. I started posting on a Facebook
    group page for recreational fishers in New Zealand and attracted the attention
    of a couple of fishers who had a science background. They approached me and offered
    invaluable advice on what they would like to see in the maps from a fishers perspective.
    Then we were approached by the company that manages the New Zealand Big Game Fishing
    Facebook group. We entered a profit sharing agreement with them, but dissolved
    the relationship after 6 months because, despite the best intentions, the arrangement
    was not working in our favour. We were able to grow the business significantly
    in the first year with virtually all of our early subscribers from New Zealand.
    Breaking into the California/ Baja market is proving more difficult because there
    is more established competition.

    when subscriptions drop off after the summer fishing season. Another challenge
    is to manage anxiety about whether the subscribers will return the following year.
    A new startup like this is definitely not a profit making business in the early
    stages. Revenue got ploughed back into new computer equipment, website development,
    and marketing costs. My partner in Fishing Maps (my wife) is an accountant and
    auditor who tracks the finances and keeps us within reasonable bounds for expenditure
    relative to revenue. It was audacious to enter this market where there are established
    competitors, but one thing I realised is that the other companies are also run
    by very small teams, in some cases by one one or two people, just like us. One
    of the distinguishing features of our product is our detailed blogs and articles,
    explaining oceanography for game fishing accurately in plain language. We set
    out to fill a perceived gap in a niche market, bringing high quality satellite
    maps backed by oceanographic knowledge to a regionally-focused potential market.
    Our goal was not to do what the other providers already do well. We are a science-based
    product. [Fishing Maps](http://www.fishingmaps.info) is distinguished by the new
    indices that we provide and are developing, and by the oceanographic interpretation
    of the structures that fishers can use to find game fish.

- en: The development process for the maps continues to develop. Receiving feedback
    from fishers can be challenging, but it leads to improvements. Seeing the product
    from the outside can be as confronting and demotivating as receiving a negative
    review on a scientific paper. On the other hand it is an opportunity to focus
    improvements in very effective ways. Nevertheless it’s impossible to balance the
    hours invested in development against the financial yields in a startup like ours.

    with negligible overheads, a fast Internet connection, and the knowledge to create
    a high-tech product. The science is fun and always evolving. The marketing is
    less appealing. Writing the blogs and articles for non-specialists is a huge change
    from writing scientific articles, but it can be rewarding. The view from my study
    over the beautiful Waitakere Ranges to the heads of the Manukau Harbour here in
    New Zealand reminds me that anything is possible when you have open data, open
    source software, programming skills, the time, and the will to try something audacious.
