    Engineer graduate who went all the way and spent almost 8 years in academia learning
    about the Energy sector (and when I say all the way, I mean from a bachelor degree
    to a PhD and postdoc). Even though that’s also a high demand career in the job
    market, I decided to switch to a data engineer path instead.

    disciplines ask about how to switch to a career in data. So this article will
    take you through my journey, and how an engineering graduate has nothing to worry
    about the transition to this new field. I’ll go through the market for data jobs,
    my story, and the skills that engineers have (whether it’s electrical, mechanical,
    electronic etc.) that equip them well for this fast moving field.

    at that position, I started looking for jobs again. Something with technical challenges
    and meaning that got my brain working. This is when I started looking for data

    Intelligence Executive”. Do you know what this position is about? No? That’s right,
    I didn’t either. All I saw in the job description was that it required 3–5 years
    of experience in Data Science. So I thought, this has something to do with data,
    so why not. I got the job and started working there. Turns out that “Commercial
    Intelligence” was a job description that was basically business intelligence for
    the commercial department. Lucky me, it was spot on. It gave me the opportunity
    to start experimenting with business intelligence.

    building automations in Power BI, then extended this to writing SQL to automate
    more things and then building data pipelines using Python. In 1 year’s time, I
    had all my processes pretty much automated and I knew that I had the technical
    capability to take on more challenging and technically intensive problems. I built
    incredible dashboards that brought useful insights to the business owners and

    are coming up all the time and I feel fortunate that I have made this switch,
    and I couldn’t recommend it enough. Was it challenging? I’ll say that the only
    challenging part in both BI and data engineering positions was the first 3 months
    until I got to know the tools we use and the environments. My engineering expertise
    equipped me well to deal with different problems with excitement and do amazing
    things. I wouldn’t change my degree for anything else. Not even for a Computer
    Science degree. How did my engineering degree help throughout this transition?

    though I haven’t used Python or SQL during my degrees, it was a seamless transition
    to these two, after getting exposed to so many things. I would even say enjoyable,
