- en: This article is a detailed technical deep dive into how to build a powerful
    model for anomaly detection with graph data containing entities of different types
    (heterogeneous graph data).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The model you will learn about is based on the paper titled “[Interaction-Focused
    Anomaly Detection on Bipartite Node-and-Edge-Attributed Graphs](https://engineering.grab.com/files/GraphBEAN_IJCNN_2023.pdf)”
    presented by Grab, an Asian tech company, at the 2023 International Joint Conference
    on Neural Networks (IJCNN) conference.

- en: This Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model can handle heterogeneous graph
    data, meaning that nodes and edges are of different types. These graphs are structurally
    complex as they represent relationships between different types of entities or
    nodes.

- en: GCNs that can handle heterogeneous graph data is an active area of research.
    The convolutional operations in the model have been adapted to address challenges
    around handling different node types and their relationships in a heterogeneous
    graph.
