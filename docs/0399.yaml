    collaboration of AI agents. The agents can adopt specific roles, share common
    objectives, and — as a whole — function as an efficient team. It is open source
    and built upon [Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/). Some alternatives in the
    same field are [Microsofts AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/) and
    [ChatDev](https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev).'

    sense. Each large language model has inherently a certain bias, based on the training
    data and training optimization (eg. RLHF).

- en: 'For example: I found it striking that in my example the model proposed laundry
    detergent only to men when they are not married. Was this just by chance or is
    it supposing that married men in a household don’t take care of laundry? Maybe
    because the model has only seen couples where only women do the laundry? This
    might statistically be correct, but the fact is that we don’t know which other
    biases there are. We should be wary about putting these frameworks in production
    without scrutiny, as they may propagate stereotypes around gender, politics, religion,
    ethnicity, etc. It is still a field of ongoing research to mitigate these risks.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My results demonstrate that the AI agents can reason to pick the best products
    based on customer profiles and provide spot-on promotional messages tailored to
    each customer, taking into account factors such as age, gender, marital status,
    and income.

- en: We saw autonomous AI agents collaborate, delegate or be assigned a sub task,
    call for help and review each others work. When they do that, their output quality
    is significantly amplified, resulting in more reliable and common-sense decisions.
    Frameworks like CrewAI offer a straightforward, yet effective way to harness this
    power by allowing natural language instructions. I also touched on the subject
    of the common knowledge ingrained in LLMs and that there will be bias and one
    should strive for fairness.
