    in very quirky and authentic places (my favourite has to be a Shepherd's Hut with
    a horse outside the door) I’ve recently realised that my recent experiences don’t
    live up to the expectations of Airbnb’s marketing.

- en: Last week I stayed at an Airbnb for a weekend. I did a little treasure hunt
    involving unlocking many padlocks to find the keys. And I opened the door to a
    spotless flat which looked exactly like the pictures. But I was surprised to see
    no books or candles. It was completely empty, like no one had ever really lived
    there. The next day I didn’t meet any neighbours. I didn’t receive any restaurant
    recommendations from my host. And on the last day I left, leaving the keys inside,
    no one to wave me goodbye. I thought, have I just stayed in a hotel? Is this what
    Airbnb has turned into?

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because, when booking accommodation from a “real estate investor” or host with
    a large portfolio of listings, we’ll likely be staying in a hotel-like business
    which has bought flats around the city to rent out. In that case, our host’s motivations
    will be primarily financial. Our stay will have been optimised for profit rather
    than the personal, local touch that Airbnb promised through its marketing. Essentially,
    the only real difference from a hotel stay will be access to a kitchen.

    by looking at the data, we’ve uncovered that **3 out of 5 listings** are hotel-like
    flats owned by rental **investors** (except when rentals are regulated). This
    disconnect between marketing perception and reality highlights, not only the influence
    of branding in our views, but the importance of initiatives such as InsideAirbnb.
