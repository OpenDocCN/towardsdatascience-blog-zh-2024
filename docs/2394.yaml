    for the success of e-commerce platforms. CPR aims to provide the most relevant
    products that are often purchased and bought together. Phones and phone cases
    are frequently bought together. Tennis balls are often bought while purchasing
    tennis rackets. A Mouse is bought after the purchase of a laptop. In this article,
    we will discuss how Amazon solved CPR as a product-to-product recommendation problem:'

    that are complementary to the “query” product such that they can be bought together
    to serve a joint intention.

    the challenges faced while solving this problem using a simple example. Given
    a tennis racket as a “query product”, the platform displays three lists of relevant
    products.
