    several work anniversaries, including yours. How time flies! At the end of the
    month, you will complete three years in this role.

- en: 'Is it true that as we get older, time seems to pass faster? I heard one explanation
    that might make sense: when you are 10 years old, one year accounts for 10% of
    your life. However, when you reach 30, a year only represents about 3% of your
    life, which is why you feel time is speeding up. I thought about all those purposeless,
    long summer days you spent capturing tadpoles in the ponds and rewatching cartoons,
    believing the afternoon would never end. Now, each day slips away like sand falling
    through fingers.'

- en: Maybe time has always passed by at a steady speed, but it’s passing by a different
    you. To have youth is to afford to waste every minute and still believe there
    is a sunrise tomorrow. As you age, the inner clock starts ticking louder, reminding
    you that you have one…
