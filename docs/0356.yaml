    industry since 2021.

- en: I joined my company as a data analyst and worked my way up to becoming an Analytics
    Consultant. I interned for a year while I was in grad school (2020–2021) but this,
    was my first ever 9–5 job and it was nerve-wracking to find a place for myself
    in an ocean of professionals with a multitude of skills and talents.

    I have unique strengths and skills that I bring to the table, and a perfected-over-time
    9–5 routine at workday. Each of my days at work looks very different and that
    is what I love about my job — no two days are the same, so I stay far away from
    getting bored or saturated.'

    conversations I have in a day have a lot in common so, I can write up this blog
    about a day in my life as an Analytics Consultant.
