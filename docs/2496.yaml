    this was a good time to write this post.

    how it works, then bring in the concept of an energy function and minimizing it
    locally, then cover the special case introduced in my PhD thesis, then come back
    to the more general case and discuss associative memories and optimization use
    cases, then come back to the special case to instantiate these applications in
    a more specific setting.

- en: Interpret it as follows. We have two neurons, each can take on a value of 1
    (think “firing”) or -1 (think “not firing”). The two neurons are connected by
    a positive weight, denoting a synapse of positive influence. Meaning that, from
    the perspective of any one of the neurons, say the first one, it wants the other
    one to be in the same state as it is — “firing” or “not firing”.
