    season: that exciting time of the year when many data and machine learning professionals
    assess their career growth and explore new opportunities, and newcomers to the
    field plan the next steps towards landing their first job. (It’s also when companies
    tend to ramp up their hiring after the end-of-year lull.)'

    and the occasional moment of self-doubt. To help you calmly chart your own path
    and avoid unnecessary second-guessing (of yourself as well as of hiring teams,
    colleagues, and others), we put together a special edition of the Variable focused
    on career transitions for both new and current practitioners.

    academic backgrounds, and the lineup of articles we’re presenting here reflects
    that range, too. Whether you’re thinking about a switch to management, are about
    to jump into your first startup job, or are in the midst of transitioning to data
    science from a totally different discipline, you’ll find some concrete, experience-based
    insights to learn from.

    your goal is to jump across discipline lines, one of the toughest challenges is

    debut TDS article offers a detailed account of the author’s successful repositioning
    from a trained electrical engineer to a data engineer—a change that is far more
    substantive than the title alone suggests.'

    background in the so-called hard sciences doesn’t always map directly onto data-focused
    job descriptions. As [Radmila M.](https://medium.com/u/1b144e8ba52a?source=post_page---user_mention--9d8aac763d10--------------------------------)
    explains, however, the benefits of applying your hard-earned STEM expertise once
    you’ve moved on to data science are many — and can manifest themselves in unexpected
    moments when traditional problem-solving approaches fail to produce the desired
    outcome.'

    yourself up for success doesn’t involve a fixed formula; in fields as dynamic
    as data science and machine learning, the very definition of your role can evolve
    from one month to the next. This has been especially true in the past couple of
    years, as generative-AI tools and LLMs have transformed core workflows across
    industries. [Anna Via](https://medium.com/u/c1a8933ed8b?source=post_page---user_mention--9d8aac763d10--------------------------------)

    point [Claudia Ng](https://medium.com/u/ba2da7b3b9c8?source=post_page---user_mention--9d8aac763d10--------------------------------)
