    our lives. For example, our energy supply relies on sufficient rainfall for hydroelectric
    power. As a child, I remember having continuous blackouts. Unfortunately, Ecuador
    has not been resilient. At the time of writing this article, we are experiencing
    blackouts again. Paradoxically, El Niño Southern Oscillation brings us flooding
    every year. I love hiking, and with great sadness, I saw how our glaciers have
    retreated.

    (EO) relies mainly on satellite images. Thus, CV is a well-suited tool for climate
    change analysis. To understand climate patterns from images, several techniques
    are necessary. Some of the most important are classification, object detection,
    and segmentation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Classification:** involves categorizing (single) images based on predefined
    classes (single labels). Fire detection and burned area mapping use image classification
    techniques on satellite images. These images provide spectral signatures linked
    to burned vegetation. Using these unique patterns researchers can track the impact
    of wildfires.'

    track of hurricanes and cyclones uses this technique. Detecting its cloud patterns
    helps to mitigate their impact in coastal zones.'

    helps to identify regions and their boundaries. Segmentation is also referred
    to as “semantic segmentation”. Since each region (target class) receives a label
    its definition includes “semantic”. For example, tracking a glacier’s retreat
    uses this technique. Segmenting satellite images from glaciers allows for tracking
    their changes. For instance, monitoring glacier’s extent, area, and volume over
    time.'

    the likelihood of extreme events. Also, extending the timeframe of fire seasons.
    Likewise, it will exacerbate fire intensity. Thus, investing resources in innovative
    solutions to prevent catastrophic wildfires is imperative.

    of wildfires. ML methods, in general, proved to be effective in predicting these

    of these advanced algorithms is Neural Networks (NNs). NNs are an ML technique
    inspired by human cognition. This technique relies on one or more convolutional
    layers to detect features.

    CNN shows the greatest potential to increase the accuracy of fire detection. Several
    models use this algorithm, such as VGGNet, AlexNet, or GoogleNet. These models
    present improved accuracy in CV tasks.

    segmenting the data, it needs preprocessing. For instance, to reduce noise, normalize
    values, and resize. Next, the analysis labels pixels that represent fire. Thus
    distinguishing them from other image information.

    case, a massive amount of data is not processed by real-time applications. For
    instance, data from models, satellites, radar, and ground-based weather stations.
    CV demonstrates to be efficient in processing these data. It has also reduced
    the biases and errors linked with human intervention.

    this case, observations from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites
    (GOES). The data assimilation processes use even less of these data. CNN models
    select among this vast quantity of images the most relevant observations. These
    observations refer to cyclone-active (or soon-to-be active) regions of interest
    (ROI).
  prefs: []

    Earth Sciences to approach this problem. Yet, the U-Net CNN is one of the most
    popular choices. The model design relates to medical segmentation tasks. But it
    has proven useful in solving meteorological problems as well.

    on glaciers are visual (retreat of outlines). Thus, they symbolize the consequences
    of climate variability and change. Besides the visual impacts, the glacier retreat
    has other consequences. For example, adverse effects on water resource sustainability.
    Destabilization of hydropower generation. Affecting drinking water quality. Reductions
    in agricultural production. Unbalancing ecosystems. On a global scale, even the
    increase in sea level threatens coastal regions.

    of satellite images needs experts to digitalize and analyze them. CV can help
    to automate this process. Additionally, computer vision can make the process more
    efficient. For example, allowing the incorporation of more data into the modeling.
    CNN models such as GlacierNet harness the power of deep learning to track glaciers.

    object detection, and also edge detection. CV can perform even more complex tasks.
    Comparing glacier images over time is one example. Likewise, determining the velocity
    of movement of glaciers and even their thickness. These are powerful tools to
    track glacier dynamics. These processes can extract valuable information for adaptation
    purposes.

    tracking cyclone formation and glacier retreats. CV is transforming how to monitor,
    predict, and project climate impacts. The study of these impacts relies on CV
    techniques. For example, classification, object detection, and segmentation. Finally,
    several challenges arise in the intersection between CV and climate change. For
    instance, managing multiple sources of data. Enhancing the interpretability of
    machine learning models. Generating high-quality labeled samples to train CV models.
    And incorporating ethical considerations when designing an AI system. A subsequent
    article will present a guide to collecting and curating image datasets. In particular,
    those relevant to climate change.
