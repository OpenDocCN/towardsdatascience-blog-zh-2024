    is an R package to build interactive web applications that can run R code in the
    backend. I was fascinated by the ability it provided me to create quick data analysis
    and modeling prototypes that I could share with my stakeholders and get them on
    board. One such example is this [Anomalies detection dashboard](https://hzon6a-deepsha-menghani.shinyapps.io/Sales_forecast_anomalies/)
    that I created to help my stakeholders understand my approach to the analysis
    and bring them along the journey before we moved this approach to production.

    a modular approach, especially if you learned it the monolith way. I will work
    with a simple bigfoot sightings application, built on a synthetic dataset where
    the user can select a state and see the top 10 counties with bigfoot sightings
    and sightings over time. What is the business scenario? Well, I am a bigfoot enthusiast
    and I would like to know which county I should move to next, hence a very critical
    dashboard.
