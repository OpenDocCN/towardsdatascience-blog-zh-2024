    machine learning professionals, it seemed to generate two common (and somewhat
    opposing) views.

- en: In the wake of ChatGPT’s splashy arrival, some commentators declared it an essential
    task that would soon take over entire product and ML teams; six-figure job postings
    for prompt engineers soon followed. At the same time, skeptics argued that it
    was not much more than an intermediary approach to fill in the gaps in LLMs’ current
    abilities, and as models’ performance improves, the need for specialized prompting
    knowledge would dissipate.

- en: Almost two years later, both camps seem to have made valid points. Prompt engineering
    is still very much with us; it continues to evolve as a practice, with a growing
    number of tools and techniques that support practitioners’ interactions with powerful
    models. It’s also clear, however, that as the ecosystem matures, optimizing prompts
    might become not so much a specialized skill as a mode of thinking and problem-solving
    integrated into a wide spectrum of professional activities.

    three-part series is a great place to start exploring the different approaches
    for making these massive, unwieldy, and occasionally unpredictable models produce
    dependable results. The first part, in particular, does a great job introducing
    prompt engineering: why it’s needed, how it works, and what tradeoffs it forces
    us to consider.'
