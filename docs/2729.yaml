- en: SQL indexing is a term often thrown around in data circles — you may have heard
    phrases like “just apply an index”. It is also a question often asked in interviews
    — “what steps can take to improve query times on table X?”. It is something that
    is syntactically easy to implement but I have found not much attention is paid
    to what actually happens under the hood. In this article I aim to do just that
    by using a relational MySQL Database (DB). I will cover what an index is, how
    to implement it, how it works under the hood, along with some considerations of
    when not to use indexes. As with many technologies, even SQL indexes have their
    trade-offs.

    this works but feel free to reach out if you have any questions. I will show the
    code I use to populate the DB in this article for you to adapt for your own use
    case and experiment yourself.

    in the article. As such, I hope I can provide valuable insights to a wide readership
    of varying technical inclinations. If you’re like me you’ll find the visualisations
