    some warned. Fast-forward to a few years ago when AI exploded seemingly overnight.
    “It’s here,” those same people said.

    will only get better, there are some things that will simply turn out better if
    a human being manages them.

    and Microsoft MVP, who first told me, “AI is not going away, especially with tools
    like Copilot. One of the best things you can do is learn a skill called prompt
    engineering, knowing the best and most effective way to ask the AI for what you
    want that will produce the most useful results.”

    elevate the application development process using AI is via [vector search](https://mdb.link/mdb-vector-search),
    which understands the meaning and context of unstructured data, which it then
    transforms into numbers.

    is exactly what it sounds like: Some folks are becoming tired and suspicious of

    show or movie written by a human, according to [Deloitte’s 18th annual Digital
    Media Trends survey](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/articles/us176942_tmt_digital-media-trends-2024/DI_Digital-media-trends-2024.pdf).'

    list of bullet points, I almost know with certainty that it was written by AI.
    What writers often do is give ChatGPT prompts like, “Give me 5 reasons why,” “Tell
    me 3 examples,” or “Give me a list of benefits,” and then use the results for
    the article. Overused phrases like “delving into” are another dead giveaway.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It used to be enough to say, “I work in tech.” Then, that became too broad,
    so we opted for, “I work in Developer Relations” (or something like that). Now,
    even *that* isn’t specific enough. For software developers to stay relevant and
    in demand, they need to be more clear on their position and the value they bring
    to their organization — or an organization they’re applying to.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’m thinking of some of the folks I work with in DevRel who specialize in a
    language community, framework, or technology. Some specialize in the types of
    content/projects they work on. We no longer do a little bit of everything. We’ve
    made very clear our priorities, and then fill in the gaps from there.

    can be hard and scary.
  prefs: []

- en: However, change also gives us an opportunity to be better than we were before,
    and that’s how I believe we should approach AI and how it’s changing the landscape
    of our careers. Solve a problem, prioritize strategy, humanize your work, and
    be specific with your role, and you and AI can work together as friends.
