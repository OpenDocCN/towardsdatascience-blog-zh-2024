    tell us many Python tricks. They are either more “Pythonic” or make our program
    faster. There is nothing wrong with these articles because most of the tricks

    no trick that applies to all scenarios. That is also true. In my opinion, it is
    more important to understand the reason why these tricks are there, so we can
    understand when to use and when not to use them.
