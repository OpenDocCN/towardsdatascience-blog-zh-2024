    is the central bank saying about small business, the housing sector or government
    finances? In this article we explore [CentralBankRoBERTa](https://github.com/Moritz-Pfeifer/CentralBankRoBERTa),
    a state-of-the-art economic agent classifier that distinguishes five basic macroeconomic
    agents and binary sentiment classifier that identifies the emotional content of
    sentences in macroeconomic communications. We train our model on over 12,000 manually
    labeled sentences from communications of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, the
    European Central Bank and global members of the Bank of International Settlements.

    All that is needed to obtain state-of-the-art classification performance is extensive
    training data for the specific application domain. Thus far, no LLM could generate
    sentiment labels for macroeconomic topics. After all, what constitutes a ‘positive’
    macroeconomic sentence?

- en: We have developed CentralBankRoBERTa. The model is based on the RoBERTa architecture
    and classifies sentences for economic sentiment. It also classifies *who* is most
    concerned. The model has initially been conceptualized for central bank communications,
    a subfield of economics that aims to quantify the economic impact of words.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The advantage of central bank communications is that one has to think about
    what constitutes a positive economic signal to *whom*. For example, the sentence
    “wages are rising beyond expectations” may be labeled as positive for households,
    who receive wages, and negative for firms, who pay wages.

- en: 'CentralBankRoBERTa classifies sentences based on what is good for whom. We
    distinguish five different macroeconomic agents: **households, firms, the financial
    sector, government** and the **central bank** itself. The agent-signal dynamic
    allows the model to classify whether a sentence emits a positive or negative signal
    without further numeric context.'

    for complex subjects like economic policy. This is because the way a message is
    received can differ greatly based on the audience and situation. CentralBankRoBERTa
    highlights the importance of this by accurately identifying economic sentiments
    according to the specific audience and context.

    applicable. After all, it does not matter whether a central banker or a CEO expresses
    good or bad news for firms or other economic agents. This is also true for finance
    ministers, hedge fund managers, journalists and other economic players whose views
    on the economy contribute to shaping it.

    on the economy by studying business and monetary policy messages. Any relevant
    text data can be used for this. Here, we use a dataset of U.S. public companies’
    earnings call transcripts and SEC filings. We then clean this data with regex
    and label each sentence using CentralBankRoBERTa to obtain a sentiment score as
    described in more detail in the next section.

    20 years of quarterly text data. To see how they track, we also label a text dataset
    of speeches from the Fed. We select only those sentences by the Fed that speak
    about firms, so that we do not pick unrelated information.

    a glimpse into the relationship between economic narratives and the market dynamics
    of businesses. Especially downturns, such as during the Great Recession of 2008
    and the COVID-19 pandemic, are accurately captured by business and FOMC sentiment.

    wrote in his book [*Narrative Economics*](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691182292/narrative-economics)(2019).
    Shiller emphasizes how stories, or narratives, spread like viruses through society,
    directly influencing spending, saving, and investing decisions. Understanding
    the power of narratives offers a new dimension to economic analysis, suggesting
    that beyond traditional economic indicators, attention to the prevailing stories
    and their emotional resonance can offer predictive insights into market movements
    and economic shifts. Integrating narrative analysis into economic models, therefore,
    could enhance our ability to anticipate and respond to future economic challenges,
    making it a vital tool for economists, policymakers, and investors alike.

- en: CentralBankRoBERTa is easy-to-use. To interface with the Hugging Face pipeline
    for both classification models, first, import the pipeline from the transformers
    package. Then, load the model using the model’s name on Hugging Face. Create an
    input sentence and pass it to the classifier. If you want to classify an entire
    data set, we have a sample script with additional code on [github](https://github.com/Moritz-Pfeifer/CentralBankRoBERTa/blob/main/Model_loader/Model_loader.ipynb).
    CentralBankRoBERTa works best on a sentence-level, so we recommend users to parse
    large texts into individual sentences. For example, in the [minutes](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20240131.htm)
    of the last Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, we can find the following
