    of the population you wish to study. A good sample, therefore, is a miniature
    version of the population.

    and to some extent **quota sampling**, are designed to come to your rescue when
    the disquieting realization dawns that your funder’s desire to obtain a magnificently
    representative sample is somehow completely detached from their ability to pay
    for it.

    name two— that are named in that special way that wraps unsettlingly unscientific
    methods in the euphemistic cloak of false rigor and respectability.

    of what “sampling” means, leading to creative interpretations.

    sitcom *Everybody Loves Raymond* ([S07E12](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0574167/),
    “*Grandpa Steals*”) as he helps himself to fistfuls of trail mix at the supermarket
    with the firm belief that he is only “sampling”.
