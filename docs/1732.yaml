- en: AI tools like Chat GPT are transforming how we approach complex ideas. One of
    the things I enjoy doing with it is integrating perspectives and ideas from different
    thinkers, as well as differentiating between them to better understand their nuances.
    This is easily one of my favorite applications of AI.

    from text input, making it highly flexible and easy to use. I’ve been looking
    for good concept mapping and knowledge mapping software, and this seemed like
    a reasonable place to start.

    of examining, integrating, and visualizing complex ideas and perspectives. Although
    I’ve now moved on to creating my own tool, experimenting with Napkin AI was an
    important first step. In this series, I will document the journey that will involve
    exploring some of the tools out there, making new ones easy to use, and sharing
    my experiences.

    type of concept map I was looking for, but it did help me visualize complex topics.
    It even helped me integrate them into practical frameworks with its Draft with
    AI option, although you can also start a blank document and provide your own text.
    If you want to edit the document or add your own images, that’s just as easy.

    business, education, personal growth, and content creation. It empowers individual
    creators to turn complex ideas into practical frameworks, supporting innovation
    and growth. Most importantly, it creates powerful diagrams that can be highly
    useful for business communications and strategy development.
