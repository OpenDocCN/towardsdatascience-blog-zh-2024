- en: Much of contemporary data science answers the question “What’s going on?” At
    my firm, for example, we often try to spot how well a company is performing, and
    how one performance indicator is tied to another through correlations.

- en: A more powerful question worth answering would be “Why is this happening?” For
    example, if we detect a significant correlation between the presence of women
    in management and a company’s revenues, what is cause and what is effect here?
    Or, if people undergo a training program, will this cause their performance to
    improve? Or would better-performing people want to undergo a training program,
    and hence we only see an effect due to selection bias?

    to pinpoint causal relationships in data science. Propensity-Score Matching (PSM)
    is one of the older ones, having emerged [around 40 years ago](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/191/10/1671/6618833).
    Other methods like [Structural Equation Modeling](https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r370.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    arose at the same time. Approaches like [Instrumental Variables](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/stock/files/tariff_appendixb.pdf)
    arose several decades before. Causal statistics is still a very active field,
    with many new methods being developed.'
