    but some things stay consistent—and one of those is the storytelling power of
    a good data visualization.

    data professionals, and we love exploring the nitty-gritty details that make charts,
    plots, and infographics click. We find it equally valuable to dig into fundamental
    building blocks as it is to keep up with recent tools and novel approaches. This
    week, we present some excellent articles covering the entire spectrum between
    these poles: if you were planning to deepen and expand your visualization skills
    in 2024, you’re in the right place. Let’s kick things off.'
