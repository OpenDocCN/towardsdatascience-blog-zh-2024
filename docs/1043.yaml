    having the mentality of a lifelong learner. The field is developing so quickly
    that it takes time and lots of effort to stay up to date with the latest developments,
    whether it’s the state-of-the-art ML model, a new data manipulation library, or
    a just-released arXiv paper you’d love to implement. No wonder so many of us (myself
    included) suffer from *imposter syndrome*.

    resource is time. We can’t (or at least shouldn’t) spend most of our waking hours
    working and learning, as we would risk burning out quite quickly. So that’s why
    in this article, I would like to focus on the development possibilities during
    your 9 to 5 (or any other time range that applies to you).

    already employ some of the things I mentioned here. And that’s great! From my
    side, I’d consider this a success if you find at least one new idea on how to
    keep learning.
