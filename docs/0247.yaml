    been impacted by significant shifts in the academic landscape. When I graduated,
    the acceptance rate at Grinnell had plummeted by 15% from the time I entered,
    paralleled by a sharp rise in tuition fees. This pattern wasn’t unique to my alma
    mater; friends from various colleges echoed similar experiences.'

    was twofold: firstly, the advent of online applications might have simplified
    the process of applying to multiple colleges, thereby increasing the applicant
    pool and reducing acceptance rates. Secondly, an article from the [Migration Policy
    Institute](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/international-students-united-states)
    highlighted a doubling in the number of international students in the U.S. from
    2000 to 2020 (from 500k to 1 million), potentially intensifying competition. Alongside,
    I was curious about the tuition fee trends from 2001 to 2022\. My aim here is
    to unravel these patterns through data visualization. For the following analysis,
    all images, unless otherwise noted, are by the author!'

    from 2001 to 2022, covering aspects like institution type, yearly acceptance rates,
    state location, and tuition fees. Sourced from the [College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/),
    the original dataset was vast, with over 3,000 columns and 10,000 rows. I meticulously
    selected pertinent columns for a focused analysis, resulting in a refined dataset
    available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ryusonoda/u-s-university-dataset-from-2001-to-2022/data).
    To ensure relevance and completeness, I concentrated on 4-year colleges featured
    in the U.S. News college rankings, drawing the list from [here](https://andyreiter.com/datasets/).'

    decades. Initially, I suspected that I would observe a steady decline. Figure
    1 illustrates this trajectory from 2001 to 2022\. A consistent drop is evident
    until 2008, followed by fluctuations leading up to a notable increase around 2020–2021,
    likely a repercussion of the COVID-19 pandemic influencing gap year decisions
    and enrollment strategies.

    In contrast, when we zoom into the acceptance rates of more prestigious universities
    (Figure 2), a steady decline becomes apparent. This led me to categorize colleges
    into three groups based on their 2022 admission rates (Top 10% competitive, top
    50%, and others) and analyze the trends within these segments.

    50%, colleges have generally seen an increase in acceptance rates since 2001\.
    The fluctuations post-2008 across all but the top 10% of colleges could be attributed
    to economic factors like the recession. Notably, competitive colleges didn’t experience
    the pandemic-induced spike in acceptance rates seen elsewhere.

    their acceptance rates hadn’t decreased notably over the years. This led me to
    question whether the shift in competitiveness was widespread or if it was a case
    of some colleges becoming significantly harder or easier to get into. The steady
    decrease in acceptance rates at prestigious institutions (shown in *Figure 2*)
    hinted at the latter.'

    Those below the line saw reduced acceptance rates. A noticeable cluster in the
    lower-left quadrant represents selective colleges that became increasingly exclusive.
    This trend is underscored by the observation that colleges with initially low
    acceptance rates (left side of the plot) tend to fall below this dividing line,
    while those on the right are more evenly distributed.

    are predominantly private. To test whether the changes in acceptance rates differed
    significantly between the top and bottom 50 percentile colleges, I conducted an
    independent t-test (Null hypothesis: θ_top = θ_bottom). The results showed a statistically
    significant difference.'

    acceptance rates; notably, Grinnell College, my alma mater, is among these top
    5 with a significant drop in acceptance rate.

    theory is that with the advent of the internet, these institutions, not as historically
    renowned as those on the West and East Coasts, have gained more visibility both
    domestically and internationally.

    two decades reveals some eye-opening patterns. Figure 7 presents the average tuition

    and the rise in public in-state tuition appears relatively modest. However, it’s
    striking that the overall average tuition has more than doubled since 2001, soaring
    from $15k to $35k.

    but a comparison with inflation rates paints a different picture (Figure 8). Except
    for the last two years, where inflation spiked due to the pandemic, tuition hikes
    consistently outpaced inflation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although the pattern of tuition increases mirrors that of inflation, it’s important
    to note that unlike inflation, which dipped into negative territory in 2009, tuition
    increases never fell below zero. Though the rate of increase has been slowing,
    the hope is for it to eventually stabilize and halt the upward trajectory of tuition
    costs.

    significantly, I hypothesized that more selective colleges might exhibit higher
    increases due to greater demand. Figure 9 investigates this theory. Contrary to
    expectations, the data does not show a clear trend correlating selectivity with
    tuition increase. The change in tuition seems to hover around an average of 2.2
    times across various acceptance rates. However, it's noteworthy that tuition at
    almost all selective universities has more than doubled, whereas the distribution
    for other universities is more varied. This indicates a lower standard deviation
    in tuition changes at selective schools compared to their less selective counterparts.

    I turned my attention to regional factors. I hypothesized that schools in the
    West Coast, influenced by the economic surge of tech companies, might have experienced
    significant tuition increases. To test this, I visualized the tuition growth for
    each state in Figure 10\.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Contrary to my expectations, the West Coast wasn’t the region with the highest
    rise in tuition. Instead, states like Oklahoma and Utah saw substantial increases,
    while South Dakota and New Mexico had the smallest hikes. While there are exceptions,
    the overall trend suggests that tuition increases in the western states generally
    outpace those in the eastern states.
