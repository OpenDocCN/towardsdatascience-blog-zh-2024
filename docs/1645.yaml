    statistical jargon including terms such as “confidence”, “power”, “p-value”, “t-test”,
    “effect size”, and so on.

    to understand A/B testing — quite the opposite. In fact, simulations can replace
    most of those statistical artifacts that were necessary 100 years ago.

    be measured using something that, unlike “confidence” and “power”, is understandable
    by anyone in the company: dollars.'
