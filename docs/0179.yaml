    manufacturers just a bit more complicated is the EU Data Act,[[1]](#_ftn1) that
    now comes on top of the GDPR, only to be smushed in a sandwich once the AI act
    comes into force. Will this sandwich always have all its layers? Well, most certainly
    not, but this will be the case in a wide variety of situations and for a wide
    variety of products. Why? To answer this question let’s consider a case study
    of IntelliCar, a new (fictitious) smart connected car producer, determined to
    conquer this strong market and some dominant players in it.

    cars for the European market. In order to get the desired answer when looking
    into the magic mirror and asking who has the smartest car of them all, IntelliCar
    thought long and hard and decided to equip their super smart cars with: facial
    and emotion recognition automatically adjusting the car temperature and sending
    warnings when the driver dozes off, optional usage-based car insurance,[[2]](#_ftn2)
    its very own ChatGPT powered virtual assistant, and a whole bunch of other safety
    and driving-experience enhancing technologies. However, the three mentioned already
    suffice to make my point, so I will stop myself here. Now, to be fully honest,
    any single one of the three listed technologies would be enough to trigger the
    application of the EU Data Act, the GDPR and the AI Act, but I wanted to mention
    a couple of interesting provisions of the EU Data Act (the article is going to
    be more focused on it), so bear with me here.'

- en: First things first, the situation with the GDPR is pretty straightforward in
    the described case. We have three technologies in the car all of which will collect
    (a lot of) personal data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The car will first collect facial data in order to recognize the user and check
    whether the driver has given his consent for subsequent processing operations.
    (Now, we can’t expect IntelliCar to account for this initial act of processing
    as well, it’s just all too complicated, and the dominant players aren’t paying
    much attention to it either so surely as a startup, they can afford to look the
    other way?) If the consent is recorded the car will continue to collect and process
    the facial expressions in order to adjust the car temperature, send alerts if
    signs of doziness appear and even ask the driver what’s wrong through its voice
    assistant feature. Second, if the driver also opted for usage-based insurance
    the car will collect usage data that can be ascribed to the particular identified
    and consenting driver. That data will then be transferred to the insurance company
    for them to process and adjust the insurance premiums. Finally, by saying “Hey
    IntelliCar (or any name as decided by the user)” the car’s voice assistant activates.
    Then an almost unlimited number of requests can be made to the car including playing
    music, asking for directions or even searching things up online, because as you
    remember our virtual assistant is powered by ChatGPT and hence reasonably capable
    of performing such requests. All the collected processed data is definitely personal,
    as the face, the voice and the habits of a particular (already identified) driver,
    all constitute information based on which someone (most obviously IntelliCar in
    this case) can identify the driver.

- en: The situation with the AI Act is slightly more complicated but, as we’ll see,
    the gist is that the AI Act still applies. If anything, then to assess whether
    there are any specific obligations from the Act to comply with.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, let’s start with the most obvious one. Facial and emotion recognition systems
    are definitely types of machine-based systems that can generate outputs, such
    as, in this case, recommendations or decisions that influence the physical environments
    i.e. car temperature (Article 3). Intellicar is the one that developed and implemented
    the system and, thus, also its provider. So now it only remains to be determined
    which (if any) obligations they have to comply with. To answer this question,
    we can start by confirming that facial and emotion recognition systems are provisionally
    listed in Annex III as high-risk AI systems. The only way to still potentially
    get out of all the obligations of the Act would be to conduct a risk assessment
    and elaborate that their particular system does not actually pose a high risk
    for the affected persons, as sufficient data protection measures are in place
    and the recommendations and decisions made by the system are of minor importance.
    This assessment, even if the result is positive, meaning the system is not that
    risky after all, will still have to be thorough, documented, and submitted to
    the authorities though.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The feature recording data for automated insurance adjustments is slightly more
    complex as here it is not the company that actually has access to or implements
    the AI system. It simply provides the data (or at least it should). Data providers
    are (luckily) not a role under the AI Act, so with sufficient contractual and
    documentation safeguards in place we should be safe. but only given that IntelliCar
    didn’t in some way significantly re-adjust the system to fit it to their cars,
    which wouldn’t be all that surprising. In that case, we are back to where we started,
    IntelliCar is again considered a provider and still has at least some risks to
    assess.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, our virtual assistant might be the most troublesome of them all, as
    we have to first determine whether IntelliCar is a deployer or a provider of the
    technology. For the sake of simplicity let’s say that in this case, IntelliCar
    uses the ChatGPT Enterprise plug-in and only customizes it using internal data.
    So hopefully they are just deploying the system and can only be held responsible
    for choosing a potentially non-compliant system. But they can leave that problem
    for their future selves. First it is time to conquer the market, whatever the
    (future) cost.

- en: Now finally we come to the last (well definitely not the last, but the last
    we’ll consider here) secret ingredient in our connected car compliance sandwich.
    The Data Act. And here our IntelliCar will find itself under attack on all three
    fronts (pretty straightforwardly) as a manufacturer of a connected product. And
    just to linger on this Act that received undeservingly little attention in the
    public, there are multiple booby traps to be on the lookout for here.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Data Act primarily serves the purpose of empowering users by granting them
    various access rights not just to the personal data collected during the use of
    connected products but also to non-personal data, such as data indicating hardware
    status and malfunctions (Recital 15). Now, although when it comes to connected
    products, which are most often used by natural persons, it is fairly safe to say
    that a lot of the collected data will be personal. It is still good to keep in
    mind that the users have to be able to access ALL collected data (metadata necessary
    for interpreting the original data included). And this has to be possible easily,
    securely, free of charge, and, at best, in a comprehensible machine-readable,
    and directly accessible format. (Piece of cake!) Of course, the Act brings a whole
    bunch of other obligations, in particular regarding information sharing, depending
    on the role a particular company (or natural person) has under it. I won’t go
    into all of them, but I will mention a couple of particularly interesting ones
    relevant to my imaginary context.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first one is the way the Act deals with trade secrets. Namely, in situations
    when the user cannot access the data directly, data has to be provided to the
    user by the data holder. Now, a lot of this data is going to be very valuable
    to the company holding it, maybe even as valuable as to put it on the pedestal
    of a trade secret. These secrets are in fact technical or organizational information
    that have commercial value, are purposefully kept secret, and to which access
    is limited. And so, while individual data points might not merit this status,
    when we think about more complex collections built from collected data points,
    potentially enriched with third-party data and even inferences, these collections
    might very well merit trade secret protection. And while the GDPR would never
    even consider the idea that a user couldn’t access a profile built based on his
    data, the Data Act does consider this possibility. Primarily because it also governs
    the sharing of non-personal data. So, in certain cases where the risk of suffering
    serious economic damage is demonstrated the data holder may withhold the requested
    data on the basis of it being a trade secret. This exception might leave some
    wiggle room for the companies to not share all of their valuable data after all.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second peculiarity concerns our usage-based insurance premium, as the Act
    also regulates smart contracts. Meaning contracts where “*a computer program [is]
    used for the automated execution of an agreement … using a sequence of electronic
    records”*. One example of such a smart contract could be automated insurance adjustments
    based on real-time data. And one important obligation in this regard is the smart
    contract *kill switch* that has to be implemented as “*a mechanism … to terminate
    the continued execution of transactions and that … includes internal functions
    which can reset or instruct the contract to stop or interrupt the operation*”.
    This *kill switch* poses important questions as to the consequences it has for
    the driver, IntelliCar, as well as the insurance company. Namely, it raises questions
    such as who is entitled to use the kill switch, when can it be used (contracts
    are contracts for a reason and their execution is in most cases a good, legally
    mandated thing), what happens when someone uses it (does the premium fall back
    to a default mode?), and can clicking the *kill switch* be reversed (how to account
    for the unrecorded driving time)? All this will have to be (most likely) contractually
    regulated between the parties involved and is no trivial matter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, one last headache we’ll consider is that virtual assistants are also
    explicitly regulated by the Data Act (Article 31). Virtual assistant, in the context
    of the act, means “*software that can process demands, tasks or questions including
    those based on audio, written input, gestures or motions, and that, based on those
    demands, tasks or questions, provides access to other services or controls the
    functions of connected products”*. Now this basically opens up a Pandora’s box
    not just for our smart car producer but potentially also for the company developing
    the virtual assistant, possibly dragging them into yet another 70 pages of legislative
    texts to comply with. (As if they didn’t have enough on their plate already.)
    And how the trade secret argument (or maybe excuse) would play out in this context
    can be anybody’s guess.

- en: As the EU data and technology regulations keep piling up, I have no choice but
    to imagine how all of them will work together or rather if they can work together
    at all. Most of all, because complying with all the obligations from all these
    Acts (whatever did happen to regulations) is no one-man job. Unless that man is
    a machine (no pun intended) with unlimited brain storage capacity. Already the
    GDPR is a piece of work compliance-wise, so when we add all these novelties on
    top, your compliance budget now has to account for a team of lawyers, who are
    capable of communicating with a team of programmers, who are then able to program
    all these obligations into a system. The reason I chose smart cars for my example
    is because all of these technologies exist and are implemented in any single given
    connected car. And all of the described assessments, obligations, and considerations
    (just to overstate the complexity point once again) come on top of a whole lot
    of technical and safety regulations that all cars have to comply with. (Dumb and
    unconnected ones included.) Now, with all the new features, it appears the connected
    cars are basically turning into compliance nightmares on four wheels. Nothing
    else to say than good luck and let the Hunger Games begin!
