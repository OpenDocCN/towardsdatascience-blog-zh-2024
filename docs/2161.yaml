- en: The previous article in this series named [*Approximating stochastic functions*](https://medium.com/p/be7d6ccf4f6)
    introduced a novel method to train generative machine learning models capable
    of approximating any stochastic function with a single output variable. From this
    point on I will refer to this method as ***Pin Movement Training*** or ***PMT***
    for short. This because of the analogy of placing pins on fabric and moving them
    that is used to illustrate it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The method was described for functions with any number of inputs ***X*** but
    with only a single output ***Y***. The present article will generalize ***PMT***
    for functions with any number of outputs. A summary of the method will be provided
    and should be enough to understand how it works, but if you would like a more
    in depth description you can read the previous article.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The generalized method, for reasons you will learn below, utilizes an architecture
    similar to that of autoencoders. Because of this and because the uniform sampling
    distribution may be more convenient for many applications, I believe this method
    is a valid alternative to Variational Autoencoders.

    function defined as 𝑓(𝑥) → 𝑌 where ***x*** is an input of any number of dimensions
    in ***X*** and ***Y*** is a one dimensional random variable.
  prefs: []

    define as a uniformly distributed random variable in a range *[Zₘᵢₙ, Zₘₐₓ]*. This
    is necessary in order to introduce randomness to an otherwise deterministic system.
    This gives us a neural network defined by 𝑓𝜃(𝑥,𝑧∼𝑍) → 𝑌 where 𝜃 represents the
    network trained weights.

    be as similar as possible to *min(Yₓ′)* and *f(x′, Zₘₐₓ)* should be as similar
    as possible to *max(Yₓ′)*. Additionally the mid-points *f(x′, mid(Z))* and *mid(Yₓ′)*
    should be as similar as possible and of course the same goes for every other point
    in the range (see **Fig. 1).**

- en: In order to achieve this let’s think of model 𝑓𝜃 as a stretchable and transparent
    fabric on which ***X*** is represented horizontally and ***Z*** is represented
    vertically. Also let’s imagine a board with all the data points in the dataset
    plotted in it, in this board ***X*** is represented horizontally and ***Y*** is
    represented vertically. We then proceed to place the fabric on top of the board.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For every data point we place a “pin” on the fabric at the vertical midpoint
    of ***Z*** or *mid(Z)*. We then compare the positions of the pin and the data
    point. If the data point is higher than the pin then, without unpinning the pin
    on the fabric, we move the pin upwards a predefined distance so that it lands
    in a higher position on the board. The pin will stretch or shrink the fabric with
    this motion. If it is lower then we move the pin downwards a predefined distance.
    We add the distances moved upwards and downwards and call the sum total movement.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After processing every data point, if the pin was not initially in the midpoint,
    the total movement will be greater in the direction of the actual midpoint. After
    repeating the process enough times the pin will reach a position close to the
    midpoint where the total movement upwards and downwards is equal, that is, the
    number of data points above it is the same as the number of data points below
    it. See **Fig. 2** for an animation of how this process stabilizes.

    point ***1/3*** of the distance in range *[Zₘᵢₙ, Zₘₐₓ]* from the lowest point
    *Zₘᵢₙ.* And instead of moving it the same predetermined distance upwards and downwards,
    we move it *1.5* times the predetermined distance when going downwards and *0.75*
    times the predetermined distance when going upwards. Then this pin will reach
    a stability point (where the total movement upwards and total movement downwards
    are equal) at a place roughly above ***1/3*** of the data points.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    * *lower data points* or (0.75∗2/3=1.5∗1/3=0.5). See **Fig. 3** for an animation
    of how this process stabilizes for pins at *Zₘᵢₙ + 1/3* and *Zₘᵢₙ + 2/3*.

    *pins* that were used to reshape the model, however the model definitions and
    training method used the term ***z-samples*** to refer to the same concrete term.
    In the present article and in the future these will be referred to exclusively
    as ***z-pins***.

    in ***Z*** and also used the same positions on every data point for every epoch.
    This is not necessary though, the only requirement is that the ***z-pins*** are
    uniformly distributed in ***Z***.

    and in order to be able to handle multidimensional outputs ***Y***, ***Z*** must
    be defined in multiple dimensions as well (note however that the number of dimensions

    the case of one-dimensional ***Z*** and 𝑌 spaces, it was very simple to tell whether
    the selected ***z-pin*** projection i.e. 𝑓𝜃*(x, zₚᵢₙ)* was greater or smaller
    than the observed data point in order to decide which direction to move it to.
    In one dimension “greater than” in 𝑌 could simply be translated to “greater than”
    in ***Z*** and the ***z-pin*** could simply be moved up. This because we were
    mapping a line to another line.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'But with multidimensional 𝑌 and ***Z*** it is not possible to assume that the
    spaces will have the same shape or even the same number of dimensions which means
    that in order to decide the direction where to move a ***z-pin*** based on its
    relation to a data point, it is necessary to map that data point from 𝑌 to ***Z***.
    This means that in addition to train function 𝑓𝜃 to generate values in 𝑌, we’ll
    also need to train an inverse function 𝑓𝜃⁻¹ to map data points to ***Z***. This
    fact changes our model architecture to something like this:'

  prefs:

- en: The algorithm described makes the assumption that the models 𝑓𝜃⁻¹ and 𝑓𝜃 inversely
    match each other. This can lead to a slow start if we train these 2 models to
    match each other at the same time as we do pin movement. So it has been found
    beneficial to do a “pretrain” stage on which we only train 𝑓𝜃⁻¹ and 𝑓𝜃 to match
    each other. This stage is essentially an ordinary autoencoder training. After
    the reconstruction error has reached a reasonably low value the algorithm can
    proceed to the main training.
  prefs: []

- en: This pretrain stage has the added advantage that it makes it easier to define
    ***Z*** when it completes. In the section [Redefining the *Z-space*](#redefining-the-z-space)
    it was mentioned that ***Z*** is defined by an origin ***O*** and a radius ***R***.
    Having pretrained the model for some time, all we do is run a batch of data points
    through the inverse model to calculate a set *Z-data*.

    and codomain ***Z*** and ***Y***. However during training this is not guaranteed

    ***Y***.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most similar generative model to *PMT* is Variational Autoencoders (*VAE*).
    It has an almost identical neural network architecture and acts both a generative
    model and a latent representation mapper. The biggest difference between the two
    is that the source distribution in *VAE* is unbounded (Gaussian) and the one in
    *PMT* is bounded (uniform distribution).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The experiments show however, that for both bounded and unbounded target distributions
    *PMT* outperforms *VAE*. Furthermore, the reconstruction error in *PMT* is significantly
    lower than on *VAE*. The reason for this may be that the components of the loss
    function cooperate with each other on *PMT* as opposed to competing with each
    other in *VAE*. Also because of the fact that the target distribution is uniform,
    the spacing between data points in ***Z*** can be larger.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another difference is that *PMT* takes a larger number of hyperparameters, 𝑆
    (maximum scalar), 𝛾-𝑝 (pin movement weight), 𝛾-𝑦 (reconstruction loss weight),
    𝛾-𝑧 (inverse reconstruction loss weight) and 𝑀 (movement constant) compared to
    *VAE* hyperparameters which are just the *kld weight*. This may make *PMT* training
    more difficult.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally *PMT* takes longer to train per epoch than *VAE*, this is because it
    is necessary to do a pass to calculate the ***z-targets***, and also because the
    loss function has an additional component (see equation (12)).
