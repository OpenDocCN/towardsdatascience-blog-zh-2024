- en: Data scientists' work can be very demanding. A couple of weeks ago, I experienced
    the busiest week that happens every quarter in my role. During this “planning
    week”, I needed to make forecasts for four quarters, over 10,000 products, using
    the latest data.

    at various product hierarchies and layers of complicated post-processing procedures
    makes the execution no easy task, and the tight deadline allows little room for
    errors.

    every week to catch up and vent about what life throws at me. Whenever I share
    my work stress with her, she always tells me to be grateful.
