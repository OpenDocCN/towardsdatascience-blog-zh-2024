    effort, involving lively debates with people from various fields. It’s a typical
    breeding ground for whimsical ideas and clever tricks, making it a classic subject
    for debate on the best approach. To make the topic a little more dramatic, I like
    to think of it as a battle between the gray-bearded purist with a thick handbook

    of decisions, especially when facing a new problem. Experience plays a crucial
    role in mastering any discipline, data modelling is no different. Established
    rules and conventions serve as an essential framework to bridge the knowledge
    gap. Yet, there is a nuanced balance between adhering to these guidelines and
    being open to experience and pragmatic reasoning.
