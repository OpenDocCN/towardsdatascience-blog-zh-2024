- en: With this article I aim to increase the Big O literacy rate amongst us data
    professionals. We are often making comparisons between the world of Software Engineering
    (SWE) and the world of data. Whilst there are best-practices that are applied
    in both fields (such as version control, error handling, and testing), from my
    personal experience, the area where it seems data roles are lagging behind SWE
    roles is in writing performant code. More specifically, the mindset of implementing
    and checking for performant code. I personally have been guilty of this in the
    past — if the code in my script was running as expected and handling errors gracefully,
    I’d consider it ‘complete’. I believe anyone who is creating production-level
    code, regardless of job-title, is responsible for ensuring their code is performant
    at runtime.

    Big O best practices. From speaking with peers, these are largely individuals
    who work closely with software engineers and are therefore in a position to ‘absorb’
    these methodologies. This is contrary to those who work in a siloed data team.
    Whilst I can only speculate as to why this…
