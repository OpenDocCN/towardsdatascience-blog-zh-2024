- en: I can’t believe it has already been 9 months since I have been working as a
    freelance data scientist! I originally wrote about making the leap after I was
    [3 months in](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/what-i-learned-in-my-first-3-months-as-a-freelance-data-scientist-8e3417ff8165).
    Getting started my husband and I agreed that we would try it for 3 months and
    that we would know after 3 months if it was going to work. I am very pleased (and
    fortunate) to say that we knew after about a month that it looked like freelancing
    was going to work for us.

  zh: 我简直不敢相信，已经过去9个月了，自从我开始作为自由职业数据科学家工作！我曾在[三个月后](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/what-i-learned-in-my-first-3-months-as-a-freelance-data-scientist-8e3417ff8165)写过关于做出这一决定的经历。当时我和丈夫约定，我们会尝试三个月，到那时就能知道是否适合我们。很高兴（也是幸运）地说，在大约一个月后，我们就知道自由职业对我们来说是可行的。
- en: My original post garnered a lot of public and private questions from people
    facing layoffs, return-to-office mandates (which are typically layoffs in disguise),
    and burn out. I also have learned a lot more in the past 6 months about how to
    make this work. I also made some key mistakes and have learned from them on some
    things not to do. So I thought it was time to post an update to the original post.

    first because there are some important things in there that I will not cover here.
    Like last time, I would also like to give a shout out to [Brett Trainor](https://linktr.ee/bretttrainor)
    who has created on online community (it is mostly Gen X-ers, but applicable to
    most people) called The Corporate Escapees dedicated to helping people free themselves
    from corporate work. He also has a great presence on [TikTok.](https://www.tiktok.com/@the_corporate_escapee?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc)
    Brett and the “Escapees” have been great to bounce ideas off of and provide a
    wealth of information on getting started and flourishing while working as a freelancer,
    fractional, consultant, or solopreneur.

    on my own. These things included stuff like working on what I work on when I want
    to work on it and making my own rules for my company. In the past 6 months I have
    discovered some new ones and learned more about the ones I already knew. So I
    thought I would briefly describe them here.

  zh: 在我的原始文章中，我列出了几件我喜欢独立工作的事情。这些事情包括像是我可以在我想工作时工作，做我想做的工作，制定我公司自己的规则。在过去的6个月里，我发现了一些新的理由，也更深入地了解了我之前知道的那些理由。所以我想在这里简要地描述一下。
- en: First, I (still) get to work from home. I have been working from home since
    2017, which has given me the freedom to live where I want. I am a mountain creature
    and so the idea of moving to some random city away from all of the outdoor activities
    I love is not at all appealing to me. (In fact, I left the field of my PhD so
    that I could take a remote job…something that was not possible in that field.)
    More importantly, we are seeing many companies that went remote with the pandemic
    issue return to office (RTO) mandates. It is well documented that many of these
    are [layoffs in disguise](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/12/why-rto-mandates-are-layoffs-in-disguise-according-to-workplace-experts.html).
    So in reality, I have more job stability as a freelancer! And those companies
    that are laying off still have work that needs to be done. They just don’t have
    the positions to do it because they have laid people off. This means that freelancing
    is actually going to be more stable over the long run, because these companies
    will need to bring in someone to do the work!

  zh: 首先，我（仍然）可以在家工作。我从2017年开始就在家工作，这让我有自由选择我想生活的地方。我是个山地爱好者，因此搬到一个远离我喜爱的户外活动的随机城市对我来说一点吸引力都没有。（事实上，我离开了我的博士领域，是为了能够找到一份远程工作……这是在那个领域里不可能实现的。）更重要的是，我们看到许多在疫情期间转向远程工作的公司现在又开始实行返办公室（RTO）命令。很多人都记录了这些命令实际上是[伪装的裁员](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/12/why-rto-mandates-are-layoffs-in-disguise-according-to-workplace-experts.html)。所以实际上，作为自由职业者，我拥有更多的工作稳定性！而那些正在裁员的公司依然有需要完成的工作，只是因为裁员，缺少了相关职位来完成这些工作。这意味着自由职业在长期内实际上会更加稳定，因为这些公司仍然需要聘请人来做工作！
- en: Next — and this is no small one — is that I no longer am subjected to the huge
    waste of time that is a performance review. I have watched coworkers turn themselves
    inside out writing their self assessments fretting over every single punctuation
    mark only to have them essentially ignored. I have written many self assessments
    that included jokes and laughable things that managers have never commented on
    or noticed because they never read them! The process of performance reviews is
    broken. And what is the point when the majority of the time “meets expectations”
    lands you a so-called raise that is less than the increase in the cost of living?

  zh: 接下来——这可不是小事——是我不再受到绩效评审这个巨大时间浪费的影响。我曾看到同事们为写自评报告而焦头烂额，紧张到每一个标点符号都要反复推敲，结果这些自评报告基本被忽略。我自己也写过许多自评报告，里面包括一些笑话和滑稽的内容，但经理们从未对此发表评论或注意到，因为他们根本没读！绩效评审的过程是失败的。而当大多数时候，“符合预期”只能换来一个所谓的加薪，而这个加薪甚至不及生活成本的增长时，这到底有何意义呢？
- en: This is not to say that as a freelancer your performance doesn’t matter. It
    is just that you don’t have to get all anxious and waste your time listening to
    your boss rattle back to you some list of accomplishments, tell you that you are
    doing a good job, and not give you too much reward for it. Instead, the reward
    for a freelancer (or the management of a poorly-performing one) is done through
    repeat business. Does a client choose to renew or extend your contract? Are they
    giving your name out to their friends as a referral? If so, job well done!

  zh: 这并不是说作为自由职业者，你的表现不重要。只是你不必感到焦虑，浪费时间听老板重复一大堆成就清单，告诉你做得不错，却没有给予你太多回报。相反，作为自由职业者的回报（或者说管理一个表现不佳的自由职业者的回报）是通过重复业务来体现的。客户是否选择续签或延长你的合同？他们是否将你的名字推荐给他们的朋友作为推荐人？如果是这样，那就做得好！
- en: One that should not be overlooked is the fact that I have control over how my
    company-of-one runs. This has a lot of different impacts. First, I do not have
    to go ask numerous managers permission to work on a thing. If I want to work on
    something, I work on it. Ideally, there are others who need that type of work
    done that I can help. Second, I determine the finances of the company and don’t
    need to ask permission to attend a conference, take a class, travel to meet with
    a prospective client, or buy a new software tool. While it might sound silly,
    I actually am giddy (in a geeky kind of way) that I get to pick my own computer.
    I greatly dislike being forced to use Windows or Mac (Pop_OS FTW!!!) or being
    tied into a particular type of hardware. If I think it would benefit my business
    by me attending or speaking at a particular conference, I go and don’t need to
    play “Mother May I?” to get permission to go. If I decide I need to buy a particular
    book for my continuing education, I don’t need to ask someone. There is great
    freedom in this! (And, by the way, these things are tax deductible as well!)

  zh: 不容忽视的一点是，我掌控着自己“一人公司”的运作方式。这有很多不同的影响。首先，我不需要去请示许多经理是否可以做某件事。如果我想做某事，我就去做。理想情况下，应该会有其他人需要我做这种类型的工作，而我可以提供帮助。其次，我决定公司的财务状况，不需要请示是否可以参加会议、上课、去旅行与潜在客户会面，或购买新的软件工具。虽然这听起来有些傻，但实际上，我对能选择自己的电脑感到非常兴奋（以一种极客的方式）。我非常不喜欢被迫使用Windows或Mac（Pop_OS
    万岁！）或被限制使用某种特定的硬件。如果我认为参加某个会议或在会议上发言对我的业务有帮助，我就去参加，无需像“妈妈我可以吗？”那样请求批准。如果我决定购买某本书来继续学习，我也不需要向别人请示。在这方面，我有很大的自由！（顺便说一下，这些费用也可以作为税前扣除！）

- en: When you are freelancer you are selling a brand and that brand is *you*. Think
    about it like buying a car. You are not going to buy a car that is a brand you
    have never heard of. Further, you are not going to buy a brand that has not made
    a car before just because they have an assortment of parts. People buy things

- en: What this means is that it is really hard to be a successful freelancer — in
    data science or otherwise — if you have not already been working as a data scientist
    for some period of time. When clients hire freelancers they are trying to solve
    a problem. They want to know that the freelancer they are hiring knows how to
    solve it and has experience in doing so. This means that it is very difficult
    to be a successful data science freelancer as your first job out of school. Even
    graduate school. Real-world experience is highly valued by those who look to hire
    freelancers.
  id: totrans-27
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这意味着，如果你没有作为数据科学家工作过一段时间，成为一名成功的自由职业者——无论是在数据科学领域还是其他领域——都是非常困难的。当客户雇佣自由职业者时，他们是为了要解决一个问题。他们希望知道雇佣的自由职业者是否知道如何解决这个问题，并且有相应的经验。这意味着，如果你刚从学校毕业，作为你的第一份工作做数据科学自由职业者将会非常困难。即便是研究生阶段也是如此。真实世界的经验对于那些寻找自由职业者的人来说是非常重要的。
- en: The good news is that the act of getting that so-called real-world experience
    is already a key step in developing your network (i.e. the group in the first
    bullet point above). Many freelancers I know have their previous employers as
    some of their first clients. This is also why it is really important to avoid
    burning bridges with those you have worked with in the past, because you never
    know could be your client in the future!

  zh: 好消息是，获得所谓的“真实世界经验”本身就是发展网络的一个关键步骤（也就是上面第一条中提到的那个群体）。我认识的许多自由职业者，他们的前雇主是他们的首批客户。这也是为什么避免和曾经共事过的人断绝关系非常重要，因为你永远不知道他们将来可能会成为你的客户！
- en: In my previous post I suggested things like conference attendance and speaking
    as ways to grow your network further. I still hold to that. However, it is also
    important to recognize that not everyone does well at conferences. There are some
    neurodivergent people who find conferences to be difficult. And that is OK! There
    are ways to build your network beyond conferences, especially including things
    like blogging here and elsewhere! What you are looking to do, whether at conferences
    or blogging, is to grow your brand and brand awareness. When people think of you
    as a data scientist, what types of things do you want them to think of? Maybe
    you are a whiz at forecasting. Blog about it! Maybe you really enjoy writing code

    YouTube 视频吧！

- en: First, your portfolio should use an interesting data set. Do not use any data
    set from educational forums such as the Titanic data set, MNIST, cat versus dog
    via imagery, etc. Kaggle, while a great learning tool, does not always reflect
    the real work. You want the data to be as realistic as possible. It should be
    noisy and messy because this is how real-world data is. It should answer an interesting
    question (bonus points if it is an interesting question that could make a company
    money or solve a big problem). And it should also be data on a subject you are
    interested in and knowledgeable about so you can personally identify if the answers
    make sense and talk people through it like a subject matter expert.
  id: totrans-33
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 首先，你的作品集应该使用一个有趣的数据集。不要使用来自教育论坛的数据集，如泰坦尼克号数据集、MNIST、猫与狗的图像分类等。虽然Kaggle是一个很好的学习工具，但它不一定能反映实际工作中的情况。你希望数据尽可能真实。它应该是嘈杂的和凌乱的，因为这才是现实世界数据的真实写照。它应该回答一个有趣的问题（如果这个问题能为公司赚钱或解决一个大问题，那就更棒了）。同时，它也应该是你感兴趣且有一定了解的主题的数据，这样你才能亲自判断答案是否合理，并像专家一样带领别人理解。
- en: Second, you need to tell a complete story for each project in your portfolio.
    Do not just put up a bunch of code with no explanation for how to use it. Do not
    provide results from some model without an explanation of what is going on with
    the model and the data and what conclusions should be drawn. A good portfolio
    project is as much about the explanations of your work as it is about the code.
    Your explanations should be extensive. You need to demonstrate that you not only
    know how to code, but know how to walk the reader through the full start-to-finish
    story of problem to solution.
  id: totrans-34

  zh: 其次，你需要为作品集中的每个项目讲述一个完整的故事。不要仅仅放上一堆没有任何使用说明的代码。不要展示某个模型的结果，却没有解释模型和数据的运行情况以及应该得出什么结论。一个好的作品集项目，讲解你的工作与代码本身同样重要。你的解释应该是详细的。你需要证明自己不仅会编程，而且能够将问题到解决方案的完整过程清晰地呈现给读者。
- en: Your portfolio projects, when possible, should be interactive. You want people
    to be able to see that the code runs. I personally am a big fan of setting up
    an inexpensive virtual machine somewhere and running [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
    dashboards for interactivity.

  zh: 你的作品集项目，如果可能的话，应该是互动性的。你希望别人能够看到代码是如何运行的。我个人很喜欢在某个地方设置一个便宜的虚拟机，并运行[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)仪表盘来增加互动性。
- en: Because your portfolio is about brand awareness, think about what your brand
    is. For example, if you are wanting to advertise yourself as being really good
    with recommendation engines, don’t waste time demonstrating solutions in image
    analysis. You are going to be showing your future clients the types of problems
    you can solve for them. The more obvious you make that, the better.
  id: totrans-36

  zh: 因为你的作品集关乎品牌认知，所以要思考一下你的品牌是什么。例如，如果你希望自己在推荐引擎方面非常出色，那么就不要浪费时间展示图像分析方面的解决方案。你将展示给未来的客户你能够为他们解决哪些类型的问题。你越能让这一点显而易见，就越好。
- en: Finally, whenever you make an update to your portfolio, you need to get the
    word out there. Make a blog post or YouTube video to go with it. Make the code
    publicly available on GitHub or GitLab. Post on LinkedIn links to the portfolio
    and point out the new content. Post another link once the blog post is published.

  zh: 最后，每当你更新你的作品集时，你需要将其传播出去。可以写一篇博客文章或制作一个YouTube视频来配合展示。将代码公开发布在GitHub或GitLab上。在LinkedIn上发布作品集链接并指出新增内容。博客文章发布后，再发布另一个链接。

- en: If you get into this book, you will learn that the best financial stability
    while freelancing comes from having a variety of types of clients ranging from
    major clients who are steady and consistent to those who might be profitable after
    some work with them to those who might be long shots. It is worth noting in my
    case that startups, by the very fact that they are startups and especially true
    of early-stage startups, might not necessarily be considered “steady and consistent.”
    If you rely only on them then you need to be prepared for your work to be cancelled
    or your hours cut due to fluctuations in the cash flow and budget. And it is a
    bad idea to compensate for that by taking on a lot of startups (see below on taking
    on too much work). This also means that you need to have a good financial cushion
    such that if hours dry up a bit for a period of time you can still pay your bills.

  zh: 如果你深入阅读这本书，你将会了解到，在自由职业中，最佳的财务稳定性来自于拥有各种不同类型的客户，从那些稳定且持续的大客户，到那些经过一些工作后可能会带来可观收益的客户，再到那些可能是长远发展潜力的客户。值得注意的是，在我的情况中，初创公司由于它们本身就是初创公司，尤其是早期阶段的初创公司，可能并不一定被视为“稳定且持续”。如果你仅依赖它们，那么你需要为工作被取消或工时被削减做准备，这通常是由于现金流和预算的波动。而通过接收大量初创公司来弥补这一点是一个糟糕的主意（请参见下文关于工作量过大的内容）。这也意味着，你需要有足够的财务缓冲，以便在某段时间内如果工作量减少，你仍然可以支付账单。
- en: 'In practice, it is better to have an even mix of clients from companies that
    have been around for some time to startups and those in between. This will make
    your freelancing business more resilient to when contracts end or clients have

    to sue you if you do a bad job (with a few exceptions, of course). However, when
    you are working as a solopreneur that is not a guarantee. When I was just getting
    started, I didn’t really think about these things. I just figured that my clients
    and I would have a contract with a solid statement of work, good communication,
    and clear deliverables and that would take care of that. I have not been sued

    and individuals for claims that might arise out of allegations of mistakes, missed
    deliveries, or breach of contract. In fact, some larger organizations that you

    Many people have disability insurance, both short- and long-term, as part of their
    corporate benefits package and don’t even think about it. In my specific case,
    I am the sole bread winner for my family for a big portion of the year (my spouse
    works a seasonal job). If something were to happen to me and I couldn’t work,

- en: Generally speaking “long term” means beyond 3 months. If you sit down and price
    it out, you will find that the price of short-term and long-term is about the
    same. Therefore, we decided not to get short-term disability insurance since it
    is so expensive, which implies that we will make sure that we are financially
    able to cover 3 months of living without an income should something happen to
    me.

    3 个月的生活。

    through your existing, corporate plan while paying the full monthly premiums)
    or to go on the open market. Because I was having surgery while he was still working,

    on the open market for half that. It is still not cheap and it is tax deductible

  zh: 结语
- en: I am very fortunate that 9 months in things are going strong! In my original
    post I talked about feeling much more secure *not* being in the corporate world.
    That is even more true today. With all of the layoffs in the tech world, I hear
    from friends and former colleagues all the time about how hard of a time they
    are having at finding a new job. This is really, really sad and I truly feel for
    them.

  zh: 我很幸运，经过9个月，一切进展顺利！在我最初的文章中，我谈到过不在公司工作让我感觉更加安全，这一点今天更为真实。随着科技行业的裁员，我经常听到朋友和以前的同事说他们在找新工作时遇到的困难。这真的非常令人难过，我为他们感到非常难过。
- en: I also stated in the original article that my definition of success is whether
    I can sustain this model long term. I have experienced having my hours throttled
    and clients coming and going, but each time it seems that things have worked out
    since I have other work that comes up to take its place. So that seems very positive
    to me.

  zh: 我在原文中也提到过，我对成功的定义是看我是否能长期维持这一模式。我经历过工作时间受限和客户来来去去的情况，但每次似乎事情都能得到解决，因为我总能找到其他工作来填补空缺。因此，这对我来说是一个非常积极的信号。
- en: My next steps, which I hope to report back on 6 months from now, involve creating
    diversity of income streams. Working on an hourly basis as a freelancer is nice,
    but now I am looking to create other types of work, whether through retainers
    or creation of sellable products, that will generate revenue beyond simply billing
    hours. Stay tuned!

  zh: 我的下一步计划，我希望六个月后能向大家报告，涉及多元化收入来源。作为自由职业者按小时工作是不错的，但现在我希望创造其他类型的工作，无论是通过长期合同还是创造可售的产品，来产生超出简单按小时计费的收入。敬请期待！
