    quite a journey. Over the 11 months between January and November, I had 107 career-related
    conversations and applied to 80 positions, resulting in 2 offers (I took a “break”
    in May to defend my PhD 😅). Some applications were stretches, sure, but many of
    them were posts to which I thought I’d be a great match — or at least worth a
    conversation!

  zh: 2023年对许多求职者来说是一个动荡的一年。至少对我来说，感觉像是一次漫长的旅程。在1月到11月的这11个月里，我进行了107次与职业相关的对话，并申请了80个职位，最终收到了2个工作邀请（我在5月“休息”了一下，去答辩了我的博士学位
    😅）。一些申请确实有些冒险，但许多职位我觉得自己非常合适——或者至少值得尝试一次对话！
- en: The frequency with which my efforts were met with silence surprised me. I felt
    like most of my cover letters were quite earnest and my resume had unique experiences,
    prompting me to second guess my communication skills. Is my resume not clear?
    Cover letter too wordy? Am I misrepresenting my skills? Am I not actually good
    enough for any of these positions?? It was certainly a disheartening time — a
    feast for the impostor syndrome goblins lurking in the corners of my mind.

    any sort of feedback. Which parts can I improve for my next application to a job
    for which I think I am definitely a strong candidate? Many kind souls offered
    helpful suggestions on my materials, which I do think got better over time, but
    it’s hard to say what actually made a difference in the end. Maybe I finally started
    submitting strong/competitive applications after months of weaker attempts? Maybe
    2023 was a particularly rough year? Maybe I got unlucky with factors out of my
    control, like hitting fake job ads simply posted to “drum up interest” in a company,
    or ones pre-destined for an internal hire?

    Contact” — sometimes this was someone who knew me well and could refer me, but
    often it was someone who I had met once (for coffee, a zoom chat, at a networking
    event). They didn’t necessarily know my specific skills super well, but they knew
    I was a real human, hopefully thought I was friendly/thoughtful, and could potentially

    So about a quarter (4/15) of my interview requests came from a Cold Application.
    I would not go as far to say *never* apply to a position without a personal contact

    was not being rude or unreasonable in my request, but having an offer retracted

- en: My job search energy shifted in focus throughout the year, indicated by the
    density of colored circles back in Figure 2\. Conversations, applications, and
    interviews are colored by company focus (as a computer science student, most positions
    I applied to had at least some computational element, and the broader companies
    were generally tackling problems related to biology, climate, or a combination).
    Though working towards climate solutions is where my heart is, I initially convinced
    myself that I would be ok working on something not-climate related while building
    experience and skills. Accordingly, in early 2023, we see I focused more on conversations
    and applications in “Biology + Data Science” (blue circles, typically health/pharma
    applications) when “Biology + Climate + Data Science” positions were quite sparse.

  zh: 我的求职精力在一年中不断调整焦点，图 2 中彩色圆圈的密度反映了这一点。对话、申请和面试按公司重点分类（作为计算机科学学生，我申请的大多数职位至少涉及一些计算元素，较大的公司通常处理与生物学、气候或两者结合相关的问题）。尽管致力于气候解决方案是我内心的方向，但最初我说服自己，在积累经验和技能的过程中，即使从事与气候无关的工作也没关系。因此，在
    2023 年初，我们看到我更多关注于“生物学 + 数据科学”（蓝色圆圈，通常是健康/制药领域的应用）的对话和申请，因为“生物学 + 气候 + 数据科学”职位相对稀缺。
- en: 'A few existential crises later, my thinking flipped: I decided I’d rather work
    on a climate application, even if it meant my job would not leverage my years
    of study in genetics/microbiology. Later in 2023, my job application effort reflects
    this mindset shift to “Climate + Data Science” (orange circles, climate work without
    biology). While I was initially nervous to pursue positions further outside my
    biology wheelhouse, I enjoyed the chance to learn about adjacent fields and consider
    how to adapt my skills to the types of non-biology climate solutions companies
    were tackling.'

  zh: 经过几次存在主义危机后，我的思路发生了转变：我决定宁愿从事气候相关的工作，即使这意味着我的工作不会利用我多年在遗传学/微生物学方面的学习。2023 年晚些时候，我的求职努力反映了这一心态的转变，集中在“气候
    + 数据科学”（橙色圆圈，气候工作无生物学元素）。虽然我最初对从事偏离生物学的职位感到紧张，但我很享受有机会学习相关领域的知识，并考虑如何将我的技能适应那些非生物学气候解决方案公司正在解决的问题。
- en: Figure 4 roughly summarizes the total energy I dedicated to each job field within
    the intersection of biology, climate, and data science, where each informational
    convo, job application, and formal interview counts as an energy unit. Notably,
    I didn’t get to pick when I got formal interviews — that depended on someone else
    choosing to talk to me — but I decided to sum these three energy units together
    as ~instances of intense focus/stress.~ This sum does not capture other types

- en: Speculating a bit, my biggest piece of advice to pass on is to talk to people!
    Often! We all hear about the importance of ~networking~ (building out your professional
    contacts, etc). It can feel awkward and exhausting to initiate conversations with
    strangers all the time. But coming to each conversation with an earnest intent
    to connect, listen, and ask questions can be super helpful! Informational interviews
    are low pressure settings in which to form connections and share your interests.

  zh: 稍微猜测一下，我最大的建议是多与人交流！经常交流！我们都听说过~建立人脉~（拓展职业联系人等）的重要性。与陌生人不断发起对话可能会让人感到尴尬和疲惫。但如果每次对话都带着真诚的意图去建立联系、倾听和提问，这会非常有帮助！信息性访谈是低压力的场合，可以用来建立联系并分享自己的兴趣。
- en: 'Not every conversation will directly feed into a job opportunity, so it can
    seem like a lot of time to invest without a direct result. But you never know
    which ones may eventually open a door. An anecdote in my case: I happened to sit
    at the same lunch table with someone from LanzaTech at a conference in 2016 and
    kept up a casual conversation with that person via email (once every 1–3 years?).
    In late 2023 (7 years later!), a job posting opened that matched my skillset,
    so I messaged this person (and a couple other folks whom I had met from LanzaTech
    recently). I told them how genuinely excited I was about the position, which perhaps
    helped flag my application to real humans in hiring positions to continue the
    conversation :)'

  zh: 不是每一场对话都会直接带来工作机会，因此看起来可能像是一次没有直接结果的大量时间投资。但你永远不知道哪一次会为你打开一扇门。以我的经历为例：2016年，我偶然在一次会议上与LanzaTech的一位员工同桌吃午餐，并通过邮件（每隔1-3年一次？）保持着随意的对话。到了2023年底（7年后！），一家与我的技能匹配的职位空缺了，我便联系了那位人（以及几位最近在LanzaTech认识的其他人）。我告诉他们我对这个职位的真诚兴奋，或许这帮助我的申请引起了招聘岗位上真实人类的注意，从而继续了对话

- en: If “professional networking” feels intimidating, maybe think of your connections
    as a garden — not every seed will yield a fruit, and some things grow fast while
    others grow slow. Gardens don’t always flourish exactly when you want them to
    (like when your grad school health insurance runs out and you *really* would like
    a tomato to magically appear and offer you a new medical plan). But gardens make
    healthy, steady progress when periodically tended, and are generally a lovely
    breath of fresh air when you need support.

  zh: 如果“职业人脉网络”让你感到害怕，不妨把你的人脉想象成一个花园——并不是每一颗种子都会结出果实，有些东西长得快，有些则慢。花园并不总是在你想要的时候繁荣（就像你研究生阶段的健康保险到期时，你*真的*希望能有一个西红柿突然长出来并为你提供一个新的医疗计划）。但是，花园只要定期打理，便会健康、稳步成长，并且在你需要支持时，往往能带来一阵清新的空气。
