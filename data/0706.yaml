    since I was 14 years old (tell me you are from Gen X without telling me you are
    from Gen X) and in all of these decades I have always worked for someone else.
    I very much remember the dot com bust in the early 2000’s when there were plenty
    of tech layoffs, but it felt mild relative to what is going on today. Perceiving
    that company loyalty is a thing of the past along with the desire to be my own
    boss, I decided that it was time to start my own company to do data science and
    freelancing. What I have discovered in the past 3 months of doing so is that going
    solo is very viable, even during times of layoffs, with proper planning. So I
    wanted to write about my experience getting started in the hopes that it can help
    some others out there who might be having a hard time finding the next thing.
    This is written from a US perspective, so there are some mechanics that will likely
    be different in other countries, but the general ideas remain the same.

  zh: 最近我决定是时候改变一下我的生活了。我从14岁就开始工作（告诉我你是X世代的人，但不告诉我你是X世代的人），在这些年里，我一直为别人工作。我还记得2000年代初期的互联网泡沫破裂，当时有很多科技公司裁员，但与今天的情况相比，那时的裁员情况显得相对温和。我意识到，企业忠诚度已经成为过去式，再加上我有成为自己老板的愿望，于是我决定是时候自己创业，做数据科学和自由职业者了。在过去三个月的实践中，我发现，只要做足计划，即使在裁员潮期间，单打独斗也是完全可行的。所以我想写下我的经验，希望能帮助到那些可能在寻找下一个机会时遇到困难的人。这篇文章是从美国的角度写的，因此在其他国家可能会有些不同的操作方式，但大体思路是相同的。

  zh: 跨出那一步是最困难的部分
- en: Let’s face it. Many (most?) of us are raised with the idea that working for
    a company means job security. So many (most?) of us, when we move between jobs,
    are moving between companies rather than opportunities. There can be great stability
    in working for a company. You are guaranteed certain benefits like a paycheck
    of a known amount provided at regular intervals. You get other things too like
    health insurance, career guidance and management, training opportunities, retirement
    savings, etc. In going out on your own, none of those things are guaranteed. So
    it is no wonder that many (most?) people think of companies as being the most
    stable and reliable places to work.

  zh: 让我们面对现实吧。许多（大多数？）人从小就被灌输一个观念，那就是为公司工作意味着工作安全。因此，许多（大多数？）人当我们换工作时，往往是从一家公司跳槽到另一家公司，而不是寻找新的机会。在为公司工作时，确实可以获得很大的稳定性。你可以获得一些已知的福利，比如按期支付的固定薪水。你还可以获得其他福利，如健康保险、职业指导与管理、培训机会、退休储蓄等。而自主创业时，这些都不是有保障的。因此，难怪许多人（大多数？）认为公司是最稳定、最可靠的工作场所。
- en: This is also rooted in history. For a significant portion of the 20th century
    retirement was based on a [pension](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100314/whats-difference-between-401k-and-pension-plan.asp)
    and your pension was based on how many years you worked for a company and your
    salary during that time. The idea was that you were guaranteed income from the
    company after your retirement. In some cases your pension could even be passed
    down to your children. It was a great deal! But like the dot com collapse in the
    early 2000’s, [many pension programs were dissolved](https://www.investopedia.com/4-major-pension-problems-and-the-laws-that-protect-you-4692864)
    due to bankruptcy, mismanagement of funds, or other catastrophic investment losses,
    leading to the loss of retirement by hard working employees. The rise of the 401k
    retirement system was upon us. That system resulted in a retirement income that
    was portable, meaning you didn’t have to work your entire career for the same
    employer to have decent retirement savings. Hence, workers no longer have to rely
    on a company benefit (pension) to be able to retire.

  zh: 这也有历史根源。在20世纪的大部分时间里，退休是基于[养老金](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100314/whats-difference-between-401k-and-pension-plan.asp)，而你的养老金是根据你为公司工作多少年以及你在那段时间的工资来计算的。这个想法是，你在退休后可以从公司那里获得保证的收入。在某些情况下，你的养老金甚至可以传给你的子女。这是一笔非常划算的交易！但是，像2000年代初的互联网泡沫崩溃一样，[许多养老金计划被废止](https://www.investopedia.com/4-major-pension-problems-and-the-laws-that-protect-you-4692864)，因为破产、基金管理不善或其他灾难性的投资损失，导致辛勤工作的员工失去了退休保障。于是，401k退休制度应运而生。这个系统带来了一个可携带的退休收入，意味着你不必在同一家公司工作一辈子就能积累可观的退休储蓄。因此，工人们不再需要依赖公司福利（养老金）来实现退休。
- en: Going out on your own means that you no longer have the security of these things
    (salary, 401k contributions, health insurance, etc.). It is natural to be fearful
    of this. However, in this time of layoffs that rival the early 2000’s, I ask whether
    that feeling of security working for a company is just a myth?

  zh: 自主创业意味着你不再拥有这些保障（薪水、401k 养老金计划、健康保险等）。对这种情况感到害怕是很自然的。然而，在目前这个裁员情况堪比 2000 年代初期的时期，我不禁要问，是否我们为公司工作的安全感只是一个神话？
- en: Also, consider what the job market is like right now. From both my direct experience
    as well as through conversations within my network I know that open roles for
    data scientists are presently resulting in thousands of applicants. If you are
    applying for these roles, the odds of getting a call back are very, *very* slim.
    You are literally one of thousands of people they are considering. However, if
    you go out solo, you will be talking directly to the person making the decisions
    on contracting. Further, unlike many companies that post open roles and then never
    hire people into them, if they are talking to you at all it likely is because
    they have real work that needs to be done. If they are even talking to someone
    else, it is likely that there are only a small handful of potential applicants.
    Your odds of getting noticed are much better once you can make contact. For more
    on how to do this, see my section on networking below.

    infinite freedom here to define what your work life is like and you can optimize
    it however you want! In my case, I love to ski and live 5 miles from a world-class

    been what has been most striking! While I knew in theory that they existed, when
    you actually start living and working this way you can come to a much better realization
    of work-life balance. For the first time in my working career I feel like I actually
    have control over my work and my happiness. I am not subjected to the whims of

- en: There is a lot that should go into this before you strike out on your own. Much
    of it is financial. You need to know that you will likely be without a paycheck
    for a bit and it might take you a few months or more to build back to your full,
    corporate paycheck. So if you have the opportunity to save some money to get you
    through that time, it will really help.

  zh: 在你决定独立之前，有很多事情需要考虑，其中大部分是财务方面的。你需要知道，你可能会在一段时间内没有薪水，而且可能需要几个月甚至更长时间才能恢复到你之前的公司薪资水平。所以，如果你有机会存些钱度过这段时间，那会真的有很大帮助。
- en: Second, you should sit down and do the math looking at how much money you need
    to bring in per month since this will be important in determining your rates.
    In my case, my goal was to replace my corporate salary. I am the primary breadwinner
    (and sometimes sole breadwinner since my spouse works a seasonal job) for my family.
    So I looked at not only my salary, but also the cost of health insurance, how
    much money I was putting into my retirement savings, and my expected expenses
    for running the business (to include paying for lawyers and accountants). This
    determined what my gross income needed to be. Next, you have to know that when
    you are self employed in the US you will be paying quarterly estimates on your
    income taxes. This amounts to approximately 35%. Using this I was able to determine
    what my net income per month needs to be in order to break even on my corporate
    salary.
  id: totrans-32
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 第二，你应该坐下来算一下每个月需要赚多少钱，因为这对于确定你的收费标准至关重要。在我的情况下，我的目标是替代我的公司薪资。我是家里的主要收入来源（有时也是唯一的收入来源，因为我的配偶做季节性工作）。因此，我不仅看了我的工资，还考虑了健康保险的费用、我为退休储蓄投入了多少钱，以及经营业务的预期费用（包括支付律师和会计师费用）。这些决定了我所需的总收入。接下来，你需要知道，在美国，自雇人士需要按季度缴纳预估所得税，大约是35%。通过这个，我能够确定每月的净收入需要达到多少，才能弥补我之前的公司薪水。
- en: Next, you need to consider what your pricing model will be. Will you be charging
    hourly and then tracking your hours? Will you be on retainer for a fixed fee per
    month? Maybe you will charge on a per project basis? As you looking to be the
    person doing the coding (freelance) or advising on how to get a project going
    (consulting)? Maybe instead you are seeking a fractional role? Getting started,
    I found it easiest to wrap my head around the hourly freelance concept. People
    who have been working solo for a while will tell you that this is not ideal and
    that it is much more desirable to be on retainer. At this stage, my clients prefer
    hourly billing, so that is what I am doing. So it is easy to see that you can
    take that break-even monthly net income and work backwards to what hourly rate
    you should be charging to get there.
  id: totrans-33

  zh: 接下来，你需要考虑你的定价模式。你会按小时收费，然后跟踪你的工作时间吗？还是按月收取固定费用作为保留费用？也许你会按项目收费？你是打算自己编写代码（自由职业）还是提供如何启动项目的建议（咨询）？也许你会寻求一个兼职角色？刚开始时，我发现最容易理解的是按小时收费的自由职业模式。那些已经独立工作了一段时间的人会告诉你，这并不是理想的选择，实际上按保留费用收费要更为理想。在这个阶段，我的客户更倾向于按小时计费，所以我也是这么做的。因此，很容易看出，你可以通过这个收支平衡的月净收入，反推你应该收取的小时费率。
- en: But ***here is a gotcha***! I originally thought I would take that amount and
    assume 40 hours per week to work out the hourly rate. Wrong! You need to build
    in some slack because, as it turns out, most of us don’t actually work 40 hours
    per week, even in corporate. For example, I do not charge clients when I have
    lunch, walk the dog, work out, or pick my kid up from school. I also only bill
    when I am at my keyboard working on things for my clients and not when I happen
    to be [“sitting around” just thinking about their problems](https://www.findlaw.com/legalblogs/greedy-associates/a-wee-time-management-question-do-you-bill-for-bathroom-breaks/#:~:text=Double%20billing%20and%20padded%20billing,bathroom%20billing%20should%20be%20fine.).
    You also need to allocate time for networking, setting up the next contracts,
    etc. A mentor told me that a good rule-of-thumb was to assume that **you will
    actually only be billing 60% of the time**. This gives you a practical buffer
    such that you are still hitting your goal net income on a realistic number of
    billable hours.
  id: totrans-34

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 但是***这里有一个陷阱***！我原本以为我会拿这个金额，并假设每周工作40小时来计算小时费率。错了！你需要考虑一些缓冲时间，因为事实证明，大多数人即使在公司工作，也并不真正每周工作40小时。例如，当我吃午饭、遛狗、锻炼或接孩子放学时，我不会向客户收费。我也只在自己坐在键盘前工作、为客户处理事务时才计费，而不是当我在[“闲坐”想着他们的问题](https://www.findlaw.com/legalblogs/greedy-associates/a-wee-time-management-question-do-you-bill-for-bathroom-breaks/#:~:text=Double%20billing%20and%20padded%20billing,bathroom%20billing%20should%20be%20fine.)时计费。你还需要为建立人脉、安排下一份合同等分配时间。一位导师告诉我一个很好的经验法则，那就是**你实际上只会有60%的时间在计费**。这样可以给你一个实际的缓冲，使你仍然能够在合理的计费小时数内实现目标净收入。
- en: So based on this, I set my hourly rate. When I compared that rate to contractors
    of similar experience levels I had worked with in previous roles, it seemed realistic.
    (Consider that contracting shops will typically tack on around a third for their
    fees, so the rate a contractor actually takes home is typically around two thirds
    of what the contract shop bills for.) I utilized my network and bounced this rate
    off of them and they all agreed that my hourly rate was appropriate.

  zh: 基于此，我设定了我的小时费率。当我将这个费率与我以前在类似角色中与之合作的承包商的费率进行比较时，发现它是合理的。（考虑到承包公司通常会在基础费用上加大约三分之一作为费用，所以承包商实际拿到的工资通常是承包公司收费的三分之二。）我利用我的人脉并将这个费率与他们交流，他们都同意我的小时费率是合适的。

    independent contractor (sometimes referred to as a 1099 based on the tax documentation
    used in this approach). Another option is to set up an actual business such as
    an LLC or Corporation. I elected to create an LLC because it provides a certain
    amount of legal protection and separation between the business’s finances and
    my personal finances (i.e. it is hard for clients to go after your personal finances
    if they sue the business). I enlisted the aid of a lawyer to help me set one up
    in my home state. There are also plenty of online options for doing this where
    you might be able to do it yourself, but I felt the peace of mind of having a
    trained professional do this for me was worth it.

  zh: 除了为财务情况做规划外，你还应该规划业务的设置。有很多不同的方式可以做到这一点，**但我不是律师，你应该在做决定之前咨询律师**。其中一种方法是以个人独立承包商的身份工作（有时根据这种做法使用的税务文档，也被称为1099）。另一种选择是设立实际的公司，比如有限责任公司（LLC）或公司（Corporation）。我选择创建一个LLC，因为它提供了一定程度的法律保护，并将业务的财务与我的个人财务分开（即，如果客户起诉公司，通常很难追究你的个人财务）。我请了一位律师帮助我在家乡州设立LLC。也有很多在线选项可以让你自己完成这一过程，但我觉得由专业人士来处理这件事给我带来的安心感是值得的。
- en: I also worked with my accountant who does my family’s personal taxes to help
    with the business taxes. I cannot say too much about this since I have not submitted
    my first quarterly estimated payment yet, so that will likely be included in a
    future post. However, one thing that I can say at this stage is that it is VERY
    important that you save receipts for EVERYTHING. There are many expenses you will
    have such as fees paid to the lawyer, computers, web pages and domain names, etc.
    that are tax deductible. However, they have to be tracked and accounted for. You
    will save yourself a lot of time later if you start by religiously tracking these
    things.

  zh: 我还与负责我家个人税务的会计合作，帮助处理业务税务。关于这一点我不能说太多，因为我还没有提交我的第一次季度预估税款，所以这可能会在未来的文章中提到。然而，目前我可以说的一点是：**你必须为所有的费用保存收据**。你会有很多费用，如支付给律师的费用、购买电脑、网页和域名等，都是可以税前扣除的。然而，这些必须得到记录和管理。如果你从一开始就严格跟踪这些支出，将来会节省大量时间。
- en: Finally, once you have the business set up, it can help setting up a separate
    bank account for it. While maybe not required, I find this helpful since it really
    keeps the business finances cleanly separated from my personal finances. When
    it is time to get paid, the business cuts you a check. Having a debit card linked
    to that account further helps keep things separate.

  zh: 最后，一旦你设立了业务，为它开设一个独立的银行账户可能会有所帮助。虽然这可能不是强制性的，但我发现这很有用，因为它真正将业务财务和个人财务清晰地区分开。当该是收款的时候，业务会给你开支票。将借记卡与该账户绑定，进一步有助于保持财务分开。

  zh: 网络建设
- en: We have all been told, practically since infancy, that networking is important.
    That is especially true when freelancing or consulting. When I decided that I
    would start my own business and particularly once the LLC was formed, the first
    thing I did was to reach out to my network to let them know what I was doing.
    I have been very fortunate in my career, about 23 years to this point, to have
    met many great people working directly in data science or in companies who regularly
    work with data scientists. I initially started by quietly talking with a few of
    my mentors, but then when I was ready I announced on LinkedIn that I had launched
    the company. I was very fortunate that there were some people in my network who
    had need for someone to do freelancing LLM work on an hourly basis. Some of the
    interest came from people I had worked with in the past. Other interest came from
    people who had seen content of mine online.

  zh: 我们从小就被告知，人脉很重要。这一点在自由职业或咨询时尤其真实。当我决定开始自己的业务，尤其是在成立了有限责任公司（LLC）后，首先做的就是联系我的人脉，让他们知道我在做什么。在我近23年的职业生涯中，我非常幸运，遇到了许多优秀的人，他们直接从事数据科学工作，或者在与数据科学家有经常合作的公司工作。我最初通过和一些导师悄悄交谈开始，但当我准备好时，我就在LinkedIn上宣布了我已经成立了公司。我非常幸运，我的人脉中有一些人需要按小时计费做自由职业LLM工作。部分兴趣来自我以前合作过的人，其他兴趣则来自那些在网上看到过我内容的人。
- en: 'In my opinion, networking is the area where people who have been laid off (or
    other considering this as an option for layoff protection) might have a more difficult
    time than financial planning. However, that doesn’t mean that you can’t build
    your network quickly. Attending (better yet: speaking at) conferences and meetups
    is a great way to do this. Ideally, you have an employer that is willing to pay
    for you to go. Even if they aren’t, consider this an investment in yourself and
    your career. If you are running a solo business already, you can write these trips
    off. Many of the bigger conferences offer discounts to people who are unemployed.
    Additionally, most (many? all?) conferences need volunteers to help at them. So
    even if you are not speaking, you can still have the opportunity to meet and network
    with people. Writing blog posts and participating in open source projects are
    also ways to grow your network. Additionally, it can be helpful to have a portfolio
    of work for others to view.'

  zh: 在我看来，建立人脉是那些被裁员的人（或者那些考虑把它作为裁员保护选项的人）可能比财务规划更难的一项工作。然而，这并不意味着你不能迅速建立自己的网络。参加（更好的是：在会议上发言）会议和聚会是一个很好的方法。理想情况下，你应该有一个愿意为你支付参加费用的雇主。即使他们不愿意，也可以把这视为对自己和职业的投资。如果你已经在经营个人业务，你可以把这些差旅费用算作税前支出。许多大型会议会为失业人士提供折扣。此外，大多数（许多？所有？）会议都需要志愿者协助。所以即使你不发言，你依然可以有机会结识并与他人建立联系。写博客和参与开源项目也是扩展人脉的方式。此外，拥有一个供他人查看的作品集也很有帮助。

- en: You should consider that there are some tools (which are business expenses)
    that will be expected. First, just like working in corporate you should have an
    email address specific to your work. For me, I bought a domain name for my business
    and set up a Google workspace for that domain. This will also help when certain
    platforms ask for your work email address and scoff at a Gmail address. I then
    take advantage of Google Sheets for managing my expenses and time tracking. (I
    might move this to QuickBooks, but haven’t made that transition yet. Ask me after
    this first round of taxes if it is worth it.)

  zh: 你应该考虑到有一些工具（属于商业支出）是必需的。首先，就像在公司工作一样，你应该有一个专门用于工作的电子邮件地址。对我来说，我为我的公司购买了一个域名，并为该域名设置了Google工作区。当某些平台要求提供你的工作电子邮件地址并对Gmail地址嗤之以鼻时，这也会有所帮助。接着，我利用Google
    Sheets来管理我的开销和时间追踪。（我可能会将其转移到QuickBooks，但还没有进行过这个转换。如果等第一轮税务完成后，问我是否值得的话，再告诉你。）
- en: Next, I found it very helpful to have a means to allow people to easily book
    time with me. I found [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) to be a great option for
    this. If you are going to do this, I would suggest that you place some limits
    on the hours that people can book with you. Remember that when you are not billing,
    you are not earning. So try to avoid spending all of your time in prospecting
    meetings.

- en: I also have put some thought into how to send invoices and receive payment.
    Again, the idea here is to make it easy for your client to pay you. You can set
    up accounts with Stripe or Square to do this or QuickBooks can do it for you.
    However, bear in mind that they will charge fees of something like 3% on the total
    invoice. This can really add up. Another option for receiving payment is directly
    via bank transfer/ACH, which can be harder for your clients but does not take
    off those fees. Be prepared to work with your clients on what works best for them.
    And bear in mind that having a business banking account, whether for ACH transfer
    or Stripe/Square/QuickBooks, means that you are not handing out your personal
    banking information to clients.
  id: totrans-51
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 我还考虑了如何发送发票和收款。同样，这里需要强调的观点是，要让你的客户能够轻松支付给你。你可以通过Stripe或Square设置账户来实现，或者QuickBooks也能为你完成这项工作。不过，要记住，他们会收取大约3%的费用，这会在总发票中扣除，这样费用就可能逐渐累积起来。另一个收款方式是通过银行转账/ACH，尽管这种方式对你的客户来说可能更难，但至少不会扣除手续费。要准备好与客户合作，找到最适合他们的方式。并且要记住，拥有一个商业银行账户，不论是用于ACH转账还是Stripe/Square/QuickBooks，意味着你不需要将个人银行信息透露给客户。
- en: Finally, it is important to know that every client will have a different set
    of tools that they are most comfortable with. Some prefer Slack. Others are very
    Microsoft-centric, preferring Teams. While I personally have very strong personal
    preferences, I have found it important to be able to work within any of them.
    In my case, this means that I had to buy a PC since my Linux machine doesn’t handle
    Teams very well. *C’est la vie.*

  zh: 最后，重要的是要知道每个客户都有一套他们最喜欢的工具。有些人喜欢使用Slack，另一些则非常依赖Microsoft，偏好使用Teams。虽然我个人有很强的偏好，但我发现能够在这些工具中灵活工作是非常重要的。就我而言，这意味着我不得不购买一台PC，因为我的Linux机器处理Teams并不顺畅。*C’est

- en: While I began this post with a discussion on the fact that many people do not
    consider freelancing because of the lack of security, I actually find myself feeling
    ***much*** more secure than in the corporate world. For one, I am not subjected
    to layoffs. In fact, my guess is that more companies will start turning to freelancers,
    contract employees, and fractional employees *because* of their layoffs. It is
    not like they have decreased the amount of work that has to be done just because
    they have laid people off. They will need people to come in and do that work,
    even if they are not adding to their head count. Contracts will come and go and
    constantly securing contracts is part of this lifestyle.
