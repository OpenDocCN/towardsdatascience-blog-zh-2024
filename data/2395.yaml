    have time, and it is interesting. It’s not a technical story about how I built
    our [Fishing Maps](https://www.fishingmaps.info) product. It’s about my journey
    from being a fisheries scientist with no interest in industry, to becoming an
    unlikely entrepreneur selling a high tech mapping product to fishers, with a huge
    range of different technical abilities and knowledge. It is not a story about
    wild success, far from it, but it’s not about failure of a startup either. It
    is a tale about fish, which should amuse my colleagues who know that I don’t really
    like fish, even though I’m a fisheries oceanographer (see [Confessions of an Oceanographer](https://smcclatchie.medium.com/confessions-of-an-oceanographer-828fee89b7d6)).

  zh: 我要讲一个科学故事，纯粹是为了娱乐，因为我已经退休了，有时间，而且这个故事很有趣。这不是一个关于我如何构建我们的[钓鱼地图](https://www.fishingmaps.info)产品的技术故事。这是讲述我从一名对工业毫无兴趣的渔业科学家，到成为一名不太可能的企业家，向拥有各种不同技术能力和知识的渔民们销售高科技地图产品的经历。这不是一个关于狂野成功的故事，远非如此，但它也不是一个关于初创公司失败的故事。它是一个关于鱼的故事，这应该会让我的同事们感到有趣，因为他们知道我其实并不喜欢鱼，尽管我是一个渔业海洋学家（见[海洋学家的忏悔](https://smcclatchie.medium.com/confessions-of-an-oceanographer-828fee89b7d6)）。我更像是一个浮游生物专家。
- en: When I started out as a brash oceanography grad student in the early 1980s I
    had no interest in working for industry. I thought I’d be a university professor
    (that didn’t happen). When the phone rang in the biological [oceanography lab
    at Dalhousie](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/science/oceanography.html) we used to
    joke that it was [Scripps](https://scripps.ucsd.edu) calling to offer one of us
    a job. That call never came, but we all graduated anyway and went our separate
    ways. My path led me down a long series of postdocs and research associateships,
    and then into “permanent” jobs as a government scientist in New Zealand, Australia
    and California. I did eventually work for 11 years as the NOAA lead for [the CalCOFI
    program](https://calcofi.org), at the [SWFSC](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/southwest-fisheries-science-center)
    on the UCSD Scripps campus in San Diego.

    admiration, how some of my colleagues applied their skills to becoming science
    entrepreneurs. Some were successful, and some were not. One got into remote sensing
    and then into instrument development, becoming very successful quite quickly.
    Another struggled to keep a deep-sea camera business going. Some turned their
    modelling skills from government stock assessment to private consultancy. Others
    set up an acoustic survey company. One developed a tracking system for fish that
    has become famous. Their efforts fascinated me, but the entrepreneurial track
    never appealed. I was too busy writing research papers. It never occurred to me
    that I’d take that path one day.

- en: 'Fast forward 37 years (1985 to 2022). During my career as a fisheries oceanographer
    I learned about three things that fueled entry into entrepreneurship: programming,
    remote sensing, and fishers. When I was a student, spreadsheets on a luggable
    computer were a revelation. I spent so much time looking at a green screen that
    the chalk on a blackboard turned pink. Later on, when I got into fisheries acoustics,
    spreadsheets lost their allure as the data exceeded 10,000 rows and hundreds of
    columns. I had to learn to code my analyses. I’d already written thousands of
    lines of Turbo Pascal to control an experimental system that I designed during
    my first postdoc, so coding wasn’t new to me. It took me a while though. I learned
    R in my 40s, NCL in my 50s and Python in my 60s. I learned the languages the way
    a lot of scientists do, by using them to code analyses for discrete projects that
    led to publications. Eventually I learned to stitch the scripts together using
    shell scripting to create reproducible workflows combining R and Python. I took
    on becoming a Linux user, and worked with open source software. I became an avid
    proponent of open-acess data, open source software, and reproducible open science.'

  zh: 快进到37年后（1985到2022年）。在我的渔业海洋学家的职业生涯中，我学到了三件推动我进入创业领域的事：编程、遥感和渔民。作为学生时，便携式计算机上的电子表格让我大开眼界。我花了那么多时间盯着绿色的屏幕，以至于黑板上的粉笔变成了粉红色。后来，当我进入渔业声学领域时，电子表格失去了它的吸引力，因为数据超过了10,000行和数百列。我必须学习编写代码来处理我的分析。我已经写了数千行的Turbo
    Pascal代码来控制我在第一次博士后期间设计的实验系统，所以编程对我来说并不陌生。然而，这还是花了我一段时间。我在40多岁时学会了R，50多岁时学会了NCL，60多岁时学会了Python。我像许多科学家一样通过将它们用于编码离散项目的分析，进而发表论文，来学习这些语言。最终，我学会了使用Shell脚本将这些脚本串联起来，创建结合R和Python的可重复工作流程。我开始使用Linux，并与开源软件合作。我成了开放获取数据、开源软件和可重复开放科学的积极倡导者。
- en: I’d always been fascinated by satellite remote sensing, which literally exploded
    on the science scene during my career. I quickly went from using a few remote
    sensing images in my papers to requesting data from NASA. I was bemused and excited
    to receive a box of CDs full of data from the [Coastal Zone Color Scanner](https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/czcs/instrument/)
    and later, from other sensors. Handling these data was a puzzle. Each CD had dozens
    of very large files, as HDFs, or some other inscrutable format. What to do with
    it all? My software couldn’t open the files. The CDs sat on my office shelves
    for years, a monument to my frustration. Was NASA really sending CDs to everyone
    who requested data? I didn’t know, but I suspect that they were. I progressed
    to using the different GUIs that NASA and NOAA fielded. They were great for viewing
    a few images, but clumsy for research purposes. I experimented with FTP, but never
    made much much progress until systems were developed to permit the data to be
    accessed, and subset directly from your analysis code without massive download
    redundancy. Accessing remote sensing data became easy, efficient, and scriptable
    using R and Python.

  zh: 我一直对卫星遥感感到着迷，这项技术在我的职业生涯中真正爆发了。我从在论文中使用一些遥感图像，迅速转向向NASA请求数据。当我收到装满数据的CD盒时，我既感到困惑又激动，这些数据来自于[海岸带色扫描仪](https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/czcs/instrument/)，后来又来自其他传感器。处理这些数据简直是一个谜。每张CD上都有几十个非常大的文件，格式是HDF或其他难以理解的格式。该如何处理这些文件呢？我的软件无法打开这些文件。这些CD在我的办公室书架上放了好几年，成了我沮丧的象征。NASA真的把CD寄给每个请求数据的人吗？我不确定，但我怀疑是的。我接着使用了NASA和NOAA提供的不同GUI界面。它们在查看少量图像时很有用，但在研究中显得笨拙。我尝试过使用FTP，但进展不大，直到开发出了可以通过分析代码直接从远程访问并子集化数据的系统，避免了大规模下载的冗余。使用R和Python，访问遥感数据变得简单、高效，并且可以编写脚本。
- en: After I moved from plankton research into applied fisheries research, I came
    into contact with fishers and representatives of fishing companies as part of
    my work. I sat through endless planning sessions, stock assessment meetings, and
    program reviews where commercial fishers and upper level industry managers were
    present. I attended meetings where we presented scientific results to fishers,
    NGO representatives and other stakeholders. I realised that commercial fishers
    have a degree of respect for the scientific assessment process, but that they
    are also deeply suspicious of the scientific results. Their views are rooted in
    their experience, and can be difficult to shift in the face of scientific evidence
    that is often incomplete. They often don’t trust the process and resent it when
    the government fisheries managers have the whip hand. Their livelihoods are at
    stake, and that’s a fierce motivator. They sometimes don’t see the government
    scientists as objective, and there are often chronic differences in interpretation
    of evidence concerning status of the stocks. I found the meetings stressful, but
    it did give me some insight into the way that fishers think. That would prove
    useful later when I began selling remote sensing maps to recreational big game
    fishers.

  zh: 在我从浮游生物研究转向应用渔业研究之后，我在工作中接触到了渔民和渔业公司代表。我参加了无数次的规划会议、渔业评估会议和项目审查会议，会上有商业渔民和行业高层管理人员。我也参加了向渔民、非政府组织代表及其他利益相关者展示科学成果的会议。我意识到，商业渔民对科学评估过程有一定的尊重，但他们对科学结果也深感怀疑。他们的观点根植于经验，在面对通常不完整的科学证据时，这些观点很难改变。他们往往不信任这个过程，并且在政府渔业管理人员掌握主导时感到愤怒。他们的生计处于危险之中，这是一个强大的动机。他们有时认为政府科学家并不客观，而且在关于渔业资源状况的证据解释上常常存在长期的分歧。我发现这些会议让人感到压力很大，但它确实让我对渔民的思维方式有了些许了解。这对我后来开始向休闲大鱼钓鱼者销售遥感地图时非常有帮助。
- en: I retired from NOAA Fisheries and the CalCOFI program in 2018 and returned to
    New Zealand. It was quite liberating not to have to attend meetings, but I couldn’t
    bring myself to leave science behind. I began to learn Python and started toying

    big game fishers.

  zh: 我于2018年从NOAA渔业和CalCOFI计划退休，并返回新西兰。无需参加会议的感觉非常解脱，但我还是无法放弃科学。我开始学习Python，并开始琢磨一个想法——为休闲大鱼钓鱼者制作卫星遥感地图。
- en: There were several false starts and dead ends along the way before I developed
    a robust working product. The idea was to use my oceanographic knowledge create
    maps of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and other ocean variables like chlorophyll
    and currents that could be used to guide sport fishers to locations where they
    would be most likely to catch a marlin or a tuna. The concept changed radically
    along the way. Initially I had planned to sell individual maps for a very small
    fee with the idea that it would be a low value, high volume product. We would
    sell maps online for less than the price of a cup of coffee. This concept failed
    miserably, and proved hard to implement from the technical side as well. I had
    also intended to provide maps for any region of the world, but soon realised that
    this too was problematic, not just in terms of computing time required, but also
    because I wanted to be familiar with the oceanography of the region that we were
    offering maps for. We began to make some headway by offering a package of maps
    for regions focused on the game fishing ports of New Zealand, California and Baja
    California, which are regions that I know well from my work as an oceanographer.

  zh: 在我开发出一个稳健的工作产品之前，经历了几次失败的尝试和死胡同。最初的想法是利用我的海洋学知识，制作海表温度（SST）和其他海洋变量（如叶绿素和洋流）的地图，供运动渔民用来引导他们到最有可能钓到马林鱼或金枪鱼的地点。这个概念在过程中发生了巨大变化。最初，我计划以非常低的费用出售单张地图，想法是将其作为一个低价值、高销量的产品。我们打算在线销售这些地图，价格低于一杯咖啡的费用。这个概念最终失败了，并且从技术角度来看也很难实现。我还打算提供全球任何地区的地图，但很快意识到这也是一个问题，不仅仅是在计算所需的时间方面，还因为我希望对我们提供地图的地区的海洋学有一定的了解。我们开始在新西兰、加利福尼亚和下加利福尼亚的游戏钓鱼港口地区提供地图包，这些地区我因为作为海洋学家的工作而非常熟悉，从而取得了一些进展。
- en: The next challenge was how to become known as a fishing map provider. There
    are established companies already in the market so the challenge was not just
    to become visible, but also to get a market share. I started posting on a Facebook
    group page for recreational fishers in New Zealand and attracted the attention
    of a couple of fishers who had a science background. They approached me and offered
    invaluable advice on what they would like to see in the maps from a fishers perspective.
    Then we were approached by the company that manages the New Zealand Big Game Fishing
    Facebook group. We entered a profit sharing agreement with them, but dissolved
    the relationship after 6 months because, despite the best intentions, the arrangement
    was not working in our favour. We were able to grow the business significantly
    in the first year with virtually all of our early subscribers from New Zealand.
    Breaking into the California/ Baja market is proving more difficult because there
    is more established competition.

  zh: 接下来的挑战是如何成为一个知名的捕鱼地图提供商。市场上已经有一些成熟的公司，因此挑战不仅仅是让自己变得可见，还要获得市场份额。我开始在新西兰的一个休闲渔民Facebook小组页面上发布内容，吸引了几位具有科学背景的渔民的注意。他们主动联系我，并提供了宝贵的建议，告诉我他们希望从渔民的角度看到地图中哪些内容。接着，我们被管理新西兰大型游戏捕鱼Facebook小组的公司联系了。我们与他们签署了利润分享协议，但在6个月后解除了合作关系，因为尽管有最好的意图，合作关系并未对我们有利。在第一年，我们几乎所有早期的订阅者都来自新西兰，成功地大幅发展了业务。进入加利福尼亚/巴哈市场的难度更大，因为那里有更多的成熟竞争对手。

    when subscriptions drop off after the summer fishing season. Another challenge
    is to manage anxiety about whether the subscribers will return the following year.
    A new startup like this is definitely not a profit making business in the early
    stages. Revenue got ploughed back into new computer equipment, website development,
    and marketing costs. My partner in Fishing Maps (my wife) is an accountant and
    auditor who tracks the finances and keeps us within reasonable bounds for expenditure
    relative to revenue. It was audacious to enter this market where there are established
    competitors, but one thing I realised is that the other companies are also run
    by very small teams, in some cases by one one or two people, just like us. One
    of the distinguishing features of our product is our detailed blogs and articles,
    explaining oceanography for game fishing accurately in plain language. We set
    out to fill a perceived gap in a niche market, bringing high quality satellite
    maps backed by oceanographic knowledge to a regionally-focused potential market.
    Our goal was not to do what the other providers already do well. We are a science-based
    product. [Fishing Maps](http://www.fishingmaps.info) is distinguished by the new

    of the structures that fishers can use to find game fish.
